777,"Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients.^\nBACKGROUND: A growing body of preclinical research suggests that brain glutamate systems may be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants. This is the first placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to assess the treatment effects of a single dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist in patients with depression. METHODS: Seven subjects with major depression completed 2 test days that involved intravenous treatment with ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or saline solutions under randomized, double-blind conditions. RESULTS: Subjects with depression evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 72 hours after ketamine but not placebo infusion (i.e., mean 25-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores decreased by 14 +/- SD 10 points vs. 0 +/- 12 points, respectively during active and sham treatment).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is sensitive to the effects of psychotropic drugs. METHODS: The effect of a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) on the P300 ERP was examined in 12 healthy volunteers. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 1 hour after ketamine administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP.

PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration.

The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio.

The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo.

The current study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety associated with advanced-stage cancer. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized to receive either 1 of 2 doses of MDMA (75 or 125 mg) or placebo in 1 of 2 experimental sessions. The primary outcome was change in anxiety from baseline to 1 week after the second experimental session. Secondary outcomes included change in anxiety from baseline to 1 week after the first experimental session, change in anxiety from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session, and change in depression from baseline to 1 week after the second experimental session. Results: Thirty participants were randomized to receive either 75 mg (n = 10), 125 mg (n = 10), or placebo (n = 10) of MDMA. The mean change in anxiety from baseline to 1 week after the second experimental session was -5.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], -7.8 to -3.0) for the 75-mg group, -6.0 (95% CI, -8.4 to -3.6) for the 125-mg group, and -1.4 (95% CI, -3.8 to 0.9) for the placebo group. The mean change in anxiety from baseline to 1 week after the first experimental session was -3.4 (95% CI, -5.8 to -1.0) for the 75-mg group, -3.8 (95% CI, -6.2 to -1.4) for the 125-mg group, and -0.6 (95% CI, -3.0 to 1.8) for the placebo group. The mean change in anxiety from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session was -4.4 (95% CI, -7.0 to -1.8) for the 75-mg group, -5.0 (95% CI, -7.6 to -2.4) for the 125-mg group, and -1.4 (95% CI, -4.0 to 1.2) for the placebo group.

Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min.

1829,"Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nRATIONALE: Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874).

INPUT: Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nRATIONALE: Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P = 0.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI - 0.307, 2.527).

INPUT: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 100 mg of fluoxetine in healthy volunteers.^\nFluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is used in the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers (six young and six elderly) received a single oral dose of 100 mg of fluoxetine. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals over 72 h and plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. The pharmacokinetic parameters of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were similar in the young and elderly volunteers. The mean (SD) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of fluoxetine was 1.1 (0.3) microg/ml in the young and 1.2 (0.3) microg/ml in the elderly. The mean (SD) Cmax of norfluoxetine was 0.5 (0.2) microg/ml in the young and 0.6 (0.2) microg/ml in the elderly. The mean (SD) area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of fluoxetine was 7.9 (2.1) microg.h/ml in the young and 8.1 (2.1) microg.h/ml in the elderly. The mean (SD) AUC of norfluoxetine was 4.1 (1.2) microg.h/ml in the young and 4.5 (1.2) microg.h/ml in the elderly. The mean (SD) elimination half-life of fluoxetine was 2.1 (0.5) h in the young and 2.2 (0.5) h in the elderly. The mean (SD) elimination half-life of norfluoxetine was 7.9 (1.7) h in the young and 8.1 (1.7) h in the elderly.

This modified double-blind study investigated the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of psilocybin, a potent 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, in patients with OCD. METHOD: Nine subjects with DSM-IV-defined OCD and no other current major psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single-dose exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from sub-hallucinogenic to frankly hallucinogenic. Low (100 microg/kg), medium (200 microg/kg), and high (300 microg/kg) doses were assigned in that order, and a very low dose (25 microg/kg) was inserted randomly and in double-blind fashion at any time after the first dose. Testing days were separated by at least 1 week. Each session was conducted over an 8-hour period in a controlled environment in an outpatient clinic; subjects were then transferred to a psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and a visual analog scale measuring overall obsessive-compulsive symptom severity were administered at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-ingestion. The Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours, and vital signs were recorded at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion. The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004. RESULTS: Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin doses. One subject experienced transient hypertension without relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms, but no other significant adverse effects were observed. Marked decreases in OCD symptoms of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or more of the testing sessions (23%-100% decrease in YBOCS score).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on cognitive and emotional tests in healthy volunteers. METHOD: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or placebo. Cognitive and emotional tests were administered before and 6 hours after drug administration. RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly impaired performance on the Stroop test, the digit symbol substitution test, and the trail making test. There was no significant effect of psilocybin on the other cognitive tests. Psilocybin significantly increased the number of positive and negative mood ratings and decreased the number of neutral mood ratings. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of psilocybin significantly impaired performance on some cognitive tests and increased positive and negative mood ratings. These findings suggest that psilocybin may have a role in the treatment of depression and anxiety.

INPUT: The effect of psilocybin on the brain: a neuroimaging perspective.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound that has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, particularly in the treatment of depression and anxiety. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of psilocybin on the brain, with a particular focus on neuroimaging studies. We begin by providing an overview of the pharmacology of psilocybin and its effects on the brain. We then review the neuroimaging literature on psilocybin, including studies that have investigated its effects on brain activity, connectivity, and structure. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and its potential therapeutic applications. Overall, the neuroimaging literature suggests that psilocybin has a complex and multifaceted effect on the brain, which may be related to its ability to induce altered states of consciousness. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and its potential therapeutic applications.

INPUT: The effect of psilocybin on the brain: a neuroimaging perspective.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound that has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, particularly in the treatment of depression and anxiety. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of psilocybin on the brain, with a particular focus on neuroimaging studies. We begin by providing an overview of the pharmacology of psilocybin and its effects on the brain. We then review the neuroimaging literature on psilocybin, including studies that have investigated its effects on brain activity, connectivity, and structure.

We will define the signs and symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy ‐ we refer to these effects as a discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post‐MDMA depression are unknown but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained 36 hours after a single dose of MDMA.

INPUT: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) in healthy volunteers.^\n5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine found in a number of plant species. It is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and has been shown to have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animal models. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 5-MeO-DMT in healthy volunteers. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee. Twelve healthy volunteers (6 males and 6 females) were recruited for the study. The subjects were divided into two groups: young (18-30 years) and old (60-75 years). The subjects were given a single oral dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) and blood samples were collected at regular intervals for up to 24 hours. The plasma concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. The results showed that the young subjects had a significantly higher maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) than the old subjects. The young subjects also had a significantly shorter time to reach Cmax (tmax) than the old subjects. The results of this study suggest that age has a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5-MeO-DMT. The young subjects had a higher Cmax and AUC than the old subjects, which may be due to the higher metabolic capacity of the young subjects. The shorter tmax in the young subjects may be due to the faster absorption of 5-MeO-DMT in the young subjects. The results of this study suggest that age should be taken into account when dosing 5-MeO-DMT.

However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine.

However, the mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the brain in healthy volunteers using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). METHODS: 1H-MRS was performed in 10 healthy volunteers before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and occipital cortex (OCC). RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the concentrations of Glu and Gln in the ACC and DLPFC, and decreased the concentration of GABA in the ACC. Ketamine also significantly increased the concentration of mI in the ACC and DLPFC. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine increased the concentrations of Glu and Gln in the ACC and DLPFC, and decreased the concentration of GABA in the ACC. These findings suggest that ketamine may have an antidepressant effect by increasing the concentration of Glu and Gln in the ACC and DLPFC, and decreasing the concentration of GABA in the ACC.

221,"Effects of ketamine anesthesia on efficacy, tolerability, seizure response, and neurocognitive outcomes in electroconvulsive therapy: A comprehensive meta-analysis of double-blind randomized controlled trials.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for major depressive disorder. Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal.

Our study sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in SI and a more subtle manifestation, desire for hastened death (DHD), after psilocybin intervention in patients with cancer. Methods: This study entailed a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover‐design trial of psilocybin (0.3mg/kg) versus active placebo (niacin 250mg) in conjunction with psychotherapy in participants with cancer (n=29). Of those who endorsed SI at baseline (n = 11), roughly half were randomized to the psilocybin‐first PF (n=6) versus niacin‐first NF (n=5) groups. SI was assessed by summing scores on the suicidality items on the Beck Depression Inventory‐II and the Brief Symptom Inventory. DHD was assessed by combining two items from the Demoralization Scale. Results: After the first medication session, prior to crossover, the NF group exhibited no within‐group change in SI compared to baseline. However, the PF group showed significant within‐group reduction in SI from baseline to all three pre‐crossover time points (p<0.001). Post‐crossover, at 6.5‐month follow‐up, both groups showed significant reductions in SI compared to baseline (p<0.005). We found no between‐group differences in DHD prior to the first medication session. However, the PF group endorsed significantly less DHD after the first medication session prior to crossover (p<0.01). Post‐crossover, the combined groups showed significant reductions in DHD compared to baseline at three time points (p<0.005).

However, the effects of psilocybin on cognitive function and attention are not well understood. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or placebo (niacin 250 mg) in conjunction with psychotherapy in 29 participants with cancer. Cognitive function and attention were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) at baseline, 1 week, and 6 months after the first medication session. Results: There were no significant differences between the psilocybin and placebo groups in the CANTAB measures of cognitive function and attention at any time point. However, there was a significant improvement in the psilocybin group in the CANTAB measure of visual memory at 1 week after the first medication session (p = 0.03). Conclusions: A single dose of psilocybin in conjunction with psychotherapy did not have a significant effect on cognitive function and attention in participants with cancer. However, there was a significant improvement in visual memory in the psilocybin group at 1 week after the first medication session.

METHODS: In total, 71 patients with TRD were randomized to three groups. Each group had participants who received saline infusions mixed with 0 (a normal saline infusion), 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine. Participants were followed up for 2 weeks. Anxious depression was defined as major depressive disorder with a total score of 7 or more on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Anxiety-Somatization factor. Generalized estimating equation models were used to investigate the effects of treatment (ketamine vs placebo) and depression type (ANX-TRD vs NANX-TRD) in the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Patients with ANX-TRD were less likely to respond to a single low-dose ketamine infusion than those with NANX-TRD. Among patients with NANX-TRD, low-dose ketamine infusion was significantly superior to placebo for reducing depressive symptoms. However, among patients with ANX-TRD, ketamine was not superior to placebo; nonetheless, approximately 30% of the patients responded to ketamine infusion compared to 13% who responded to the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine infusion was effective for Taiwanese patients with NANX-TRD but not so effective for those with ANX-TRD.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. We hypothesized that ketamine would reduce the neural response to negative stimuli. We also investigated whether the effect of ketamine on the neural response to negative stimuli was related to its effect on mood. RESULTS: Ketamine reduced the neural response to negative stimuli in the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex.

INPUT: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 100 mg of fluoxetine in healthy volunteers.^\nThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine was studied in 12 healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women) aged 20-40 years. The subjects received a single oral dose of 100 mg of fluoxetine. The plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and its metabolite, norfluoxetine, were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. The mean (+/- SD) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of fluoxetine was 1.2 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml, and the time to reach Cmax (tmax) was 2.5 +/- 1.1 h. The mean (+/- SD) area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity) was 8.9 +/- 2.9 micrograms.h/ml. The mean (+/- SD) elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.2 +/- 0.6 h. The mean (+/- SD) Cmax of norfluoxetine was 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml, and the mean (+/- SD) AUC0-infinity was 3.2 +/- 1.4 micrograms.h/ml. The mean (+/- SD) t1/2 of norfluoxetine was 7.8 +/- 2.1 h.

2227,"Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""). Commonly, ecstasy is used in combination with other substances, in particular alcohol (ethanol). MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects, whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co-administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive, memory, psychomotor, visuomotor, visuospatial and attention function, as well as on subjective experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a four-way, double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female) between the ages of 18-29. MDMA was given orally (100 mg) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime. RESULTS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single-drug conditions. Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions, whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of age on the response to a single dose of intravenous morphine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 young and 10 elderly) were studied. The young group consisted of 5 men and 5 women, aged 20-30 yr, and the elderly group consisted of 5 men and 5 women, aged 60-70 yr. The volunteers were studied on two occasions, 1 wk apart. On each occasion, they received a single dose of intravenous morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and were observed for 6 h. The following parameters were measured: pain threshold, pain tolerance, pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and mood. RESULTS: The elderly group had a significantly lower pain threshold and tolerance than the young group. The elderly group also had a significantly lower pain unpleasantness score than the young group. There was no significant difference in pain intensity or mood between the two groups.

4356,"MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular.

INPUT: The effect of age on the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the risk of lung cancer.^\nBACKGROUND: The relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the risk of lung cancer is well established. However, the effect of age on this relationship has not been well studied. METHODS: We used data from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II, a prospective cohort study of 1.2 million adults, to examine the relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the risk of lung cancer. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the relative risk of lung cancer associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, stratified by age at baseline. RESULTS: During 5.5 million person-years of follow-up, 12,866 lung cancer deaths occurred. The relative risk of lung cancer increased with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day. The relative risk of lung cancer associated with smoking 20 cigarettes per day was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-2.7) among persons aged 30-39 years, 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-3.2) among persons aged 40-49 years, 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.2-3.6) among persons aged 50-59 years, 3.7 (95% confidence interval, 3.5-3.9) among persons aged 60-69 years, and 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 3.7-4.1) among persons aged 70-79 years. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk of lung cancer associated with smoking 20 cigarettes per day increased with increasing age. These findings suggest that the risk of lung cancer associated with smoking is greater among older persons than among younger persons.

4420,"The Safety, Clinical, and Neurophysiological Effects of Intranasal Ketamine in Patients Who Do Not Respond to Electroconvulsive Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label Clinical Trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is among the most disabling illnesses worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Research suggests that 20% to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, developing treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy is the gold standard for treating individuals with treatment-resistant depression, with remission rates of approximately 75% to 90%. However, 10% to 25% of patients do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, and many are unable to tolerate it due to the side effects. Both groups are considered to be patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, because both groups continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression, have a limited number of treatment options available, and are in need of rapid treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression when administered in subanesthetic doses through 40-minute intravenous infusions. Recently, a ketamine compound, esketamine (Spravato), that is administered through the intranasal route received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to treat depression. However, esketamine is challenging to access due to high costs and limited availability. Racemic ketamine (rketamine) is cheap and easy to access; however, the effects in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy have yet to be understood or tested. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study mechanisms of human brain cortical physiology at the systemic level to identify neurobiomarkers of response. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this open-label pilot clinical trial is to test the feasibility and safety of intranasal ketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy. The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for clinical indicators in unipolar depression. The secondary outcome is to determine the preliminary effects of an intervention on clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and quality of living. The third outcome is to explore neurophysiological changes as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and electroencephalography to measure changes in cortical excitability as potential predictors of clinical response. METHODS: A sterile solution of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered twice per week for 4 weeks (8 sessions) intranasally to patients with treatment-resistant depression who did not respond to or could not tolerate an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy. We will recruit 25 adults (24-65 years old) over the course of 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study has received ethics approval, and funding has been secured. The study is currently active. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to test repeated doses of intranasal rketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Results from this study will (1) inform the development of a larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for depression and (2) determine potential neurophysiological markers of clinical response.

INPUT: The effect of a 12-week exercise program on the physical fitness of children with cerebral palsy.^\nA 12-week exercise program was conducted with 10 children with cerebral palsy (CP) to determine the effect of the program on their physical fitness. The program consisted of 3 sessions per week of 30 minutes each. The exercise program was designed to improve the children's physical fitness by increasing their strength, flexibility, and endurance. The children were tested before and after the program using the following tests: 1) the 6-minute walk test, 2) the 10-meter walk test, 3) the 30-second sit-to-stand test, 4) the 30-second arm curl test, 5) the 30-second chair sit-and-reach test, and 6) the 30-second back scratch test. The results showed that the children's physical fitness improved significantly after the program. The 6-minute walk test showed a significant increase in the distance walked (p <.05). The 10-meter walk test showed a significant decrease in the time taken to walk 10 meters (p <.05). The 30-second sit-to-stand test showed a significant increase in the number of times the children could stand up and sit down in 30 seconds (p <.05). The 30-second arm curl test showed a significant increase in the number of times the children could curl their arms in 30 seconds (p <.05). The 30-second chair sit-and-reach test showed a significant increase in the distance the children could reach with their fingers (p <.05). The 30-second back scratch test showed a significant increase in the distance the children could reach with their fingers (p <.05). The results of this study suggest that a 12-week exercise program can improve the physical fitness of children with CP. The program can be used to improve the physical fitness of children with CP and can be used as a tool to help them improve their physical fitness.

4428,"Cognitive performance after repeated administration of the NMDA positive allosteric modulator SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: NMDA receptor hypoactivity has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by NMDA hypofunction may involve enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. In a recent suite of target‐engagement studies, SAGE‐718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10‐day repeated exposure of SAGE‐718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE‐718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double‐blinded manner [SAGE‐718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE‐718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0‐mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days. Blood samples were taken and processed for pharmacokinetic analysis of concentrations of SAGE‐718. Plasma samples were used to calculate Cmax as well as other PK parameters. Computerized testing was used to measure performance on key cognitive domains, including attention, working memory, processing speed, executive function, and motor reaction time. Assessments included computerized versions of the International Shopping List Test (verbal learning), International Shopping List Test‐Delayed Recall (memory), Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function), Social Emotional Cognition Test (emotional cognition), Detection Test (psychomotor function), Identification Test (attention), One Back Test (working memory), Two Back Test (higher‐order working memory), Stop Signal Reaction Test (inhibition), and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (paired associated learning). A mixed‐effect regression model analysis (MMRM) was applied, with change from baseline in each cognitive test score as the response variable, and treatment, visit, and visit‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and measurements within the same subject as repeated measure. Unstructured covariance structure was applied for the repeated measure. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociate State Scale, the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: As compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements were observed in the Two‐Back Test at days 2, 4 and 8 of testing (p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvement was observed on the Groton Maze Test at day 6 of testing (p < 0.05). A dose‐response relationship was observed for the Two‐Back Test, with Cmax positively correlated with an increase in change from baseline performance on the Two‐Back Test (p = 0.02). A similar trend was observed for the Groton Maze Test (Cmax vs change from baseline, p = 0.06). SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths observed in the trial subjects. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration were mild and numerically similar to those seen with placebo (TEAE: SAGE‐718, n = 6 (31.6%); placebo, n = 7 (33.3%)). No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718. No significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Healthy volunteers dosed with SAGE‐718 exhibited greater improvement on tests of higher‐order working memory (Two‐Back Test) and complex problem solving (Groton Maze Test), which at times reached the threshold for statistical significance as compared to subjects receiving placebo. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated by the trial subjects over 10 days of exposure. Improvements in executive performance, as reflected by significant improvements on the Two‐Back and Groton Maze Tests, suggest that further investigation of SAGE‐718 is warranted for the treatment of conditions characterized by states of relative NMDA hypofunction, particularly those manifesting with executive deficits.","***TASK***

4633,"Creative processes under the influence of a low dose of LSD: a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Previously scientific studies have shown the potential of psychedelics in full hallucinogenic doses to change creativity, with enhancing effects on divergent thinking specifically while under the influence of the substance. This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns, like depression. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small, sub‐hallucinogenic doses (microdosing) might improve creativity, and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms. While scientific research with small doses of psychedelics is scarce, we aimed to quantify the cognitive effects of single small LSD doses on creative processes in healthy volunteers in a dosefinding study. Methods: The study was conducted according to a doubleblind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject design with four oral LSD doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg, LSD base) given on four separate test days, with minimally five days of washout in between. LSD was formulated as a solution of 25 μg LSD base in 1mL ethanol (96%) which resulted in 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mL LSD, for 5, 10, and 20 μg LSD. Doses were administered sublingually with a 1 mL syringe. To mask the treatment condition, ethanol was added so that all syringes contained the same volume. Placebo was 1 mL ethanol only (96%). Participants were 24 healthy males (N = 12) and females (N = 12) aged 22.75 on average (SD = 2.97). All consumed alcohol and had experience with other recreational drugs. Task‐based creativity was assessed three hours post‐treatment with the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and five hours post‐treatment with the Story Writing task. In the latter participants were asked to write a (non)‐fictive story around two given words. To assess the level of divergent thinking or creativity of the story, two independent raters assigned a creativity score between zero to five to the stories and their scores were averaged to a final creativity score. The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking. Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters. Dependent outcome variables are Fluency, Originality, the ratio of Fluency and Originality, Flexibility, and Elaboration. Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days. In addition, the participant selfrated how creative s/he felt on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This was done eleven times during the test day, and daily, up to four days after treatment administration. Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations. The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers (World‐Medical‐ Association, 2013). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7102). All data entered SPSS version 24.0, where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures (GLM RM) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run on data of the AUT, the Story Writing Task, and the VAS. LSD (four levels) was included as a within‐subject factor; additional within‐subject factors were Time (ten levels) or Day (four levels) for the VASs. In the case of a main LSD or Time effect, Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category. Partial eta squared (partial η2) is reported to demonstrate the effect magnitude, and it is based on Cohen's f, which defines small, medium, and large as respectively 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50, which corresponds to partial η2 values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14. Results: GLM RM ANOVA did not show main effects of LSD on AUT parameters Fluency (F3,69 = 0.65, p = 0.59, partial η2 = 0.03), Elaboration (F3,69 = 0.09, p = 0.99, partial η2 = 0.004), Flexibility (F3,69 = 2.30, p = 0.08, partial η2 = 0.09), Originality (F3,69 = 0.28, p = 0.84, partial η2 = 0.01), and Ra io (F3,66 = 0.17, p = 0.92, partial η2 = 0.01). RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect (F3,69 = 1.31, p = 0.28, partial η2 = 0.05) on rater‐scored Creativity which was 2.76 (0.22) on average (SEM) on a scale from zero to five. GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD (F3,57 = 1.22, p = 0.31, partial η2 = 0.06) or Day (F3,57 = 0.14, p = 0.93, partial η2 = 0.008), or their interaction (F9,171 = 1.03, p = 0.42, partial η2 = 0.05) on the self‐rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration. At 3 hours post‐administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean (SD) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 (32), 212 (70), and 391 (146) pg/mL after LSD 5, 10, and 20 μg, respectively. Predicted LSD concentrations at 5 hours after drug administration, when the Story Writing Task was performed, were 69 (21), 137 (57), and 258 (112) pg/mL after the 5, 10, and 20 μg dose, respectively. Conclusions: Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users, the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task‐based or self‐rated creative thinking. Nonetheless, findings stimulate further research in a placebo‐controlled setting, and eventually in patient populations, to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration, closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations, or after repeated administrations.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 0.5 mg of intranasal oxytocin on the neural correlates of mentalizing in borderline personality disorder.^\nBackground: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self‐image, and affect regulation. The neurobiological underpinnings of BPD are not well understood. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide that has been implicated in social cognition and emotion regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intranasal OT on the neural correlates of mentalizing in BPD. Methods: Twenty‐four BPD patients and 24 healthy controls (HC) were included in this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a mentalizing task. Participants were randomized to receive either 24 IU of intranasal OT or placebo (PL) on two separate days. Results: BPD patients showed increased activation in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) compared to HC. OT increased activation in the right MTG and the right IFG in BPD patients compared to PL. In HC, OT decreased activation in the right MTG and the right IFG compared to PL. Conclusions: These findings suggest that OT modulates the neural correlates of mentalizing in BPD patients and HC. The increased activation in the right MTG and the right IFG in BPD patients after OT administration may reflect an increased effort to mentalize. The decreased activation in the right MTG and the right IFG in HC after OT administration may reflect a decreased effort to mentalize. These findings suggest that OT may have a different effect on the neural correlates of mentalizing in BPD patients and HC. Future studies should investigate the effect of OT on the neural correlates of mentalizing in BPD patients and HC in a longitudinal design.

Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitution task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most psychomotor impairments. Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose- and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mechanisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience.","***TASK***

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esketamine nasal spray in a clinical sample of patients with TRD from several Italian mental health services. METHODS: REAL-ESK study is an observational, retrospective and multicentric study comprising a total of 116 TRD patients treated with esketamine nasal spray. Anamnestic data and psychometric assessment (MADRS, HAMD-21, HAM-A) were collected from medical records at baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three month (T2) follow-ups. RESULTS: A significant reduction of depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0. A dramatic increase in clinical response (64.2 %) and remission rates (40.6 %) was detected at T2 compared to T1. No unexpected safety concerns were observed, side effects rates were comparable to those reported in RCTs.

Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system. METHOD: 100 μg LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects. RESULTS: LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects. CONCLUSION: Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non‐competitive N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment‐resistant depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nTwenty‐two healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover study. Participants received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) intravenously. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning before and 40 min after drug administration.^\nKetamine significantly reduced the subjective experience of negative emotion and increased the subjective experience of positive emotion. Ketamine also significantly reduced the neural response to negative emotional stimuli in the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex.^\nThese findings suggest that ketamine may have a rapid antidepressant effect by reducing the neural response to negative emotional stimuli.^\n

7113,"Pediatric premedication: a double-blind randomized trial of dexmedetomidine or ketamine alone versus a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients. When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication, children tend to awaken when separated from their parents, and body movements occur during invasive procedures. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients, while producing minimal adverse events. METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3 mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6 mg/kg (group K) 30 min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P = 0.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P = 0.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P = 0.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and oral ketamine 3 mg/kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation, allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia.

Part 1. Behavioural measures of tinnitus following 30 mg MDMA or placebo administration (N = 5 participants) and Part 2. Behavioural measures of tinnitus and correlations between pairs of apriori regions of interest (ROI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after 70 mg of MDMA or placebo (N = 8 participants).Results: The results to MDMA were similar to placebo. For the 70 mg dose, there was a significant reduction after 4 h in annoyance and ignore ratings. RsMRI showed decreased connectivity compared with placebo administration between the left hippocampal, right hippocampal, left amygdala and right amygdala regions, and between the right posterior parahippocampal cortex and the left amygdala after two hours of 70 mg MDMA administration.

However, neither their possible synergistic effects, nor related state and trait predictors have been experimentally studied. To elucidate these issues, we administered double-blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin (315 μg/kg PO) or placebo to meditators (n = 39) during a 5-day mindfulness group retreat. Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self-dissolution along the perception-hallucination continuum, without concomitant anxiety. Openness, optimism, and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response. Compared with placebo, psilocybin enhanced post-intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4-month follow-up, which were corroborated by external ratings, and associated with magnitude of acute self-dissolution experience. Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses. These findings highlight the interactions between non-pharmacological and pharmacological factors, and the role of emotion/attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states, as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes.

INPUT: The effect of a mindfulness-based intervention on sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia.^\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention on sleep quality in patients with chronic insomnia. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Sleep disorders clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 47 patients with chronic insomnia. INTERVENTION: Mindfulness-based intervention (n = 24) or sleep hygiene education (n = 23). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality. The PSQI was administered at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the intervention. The mindfulness-based intervention group showed a significant improvement in sleep quality at 1 month (P =.001), 3 months (P =.001), and 6 months (P =.001) after the intervention. The sleep hygiene education group showed a significant improvement in sleep quality at 1 month (P =.001) and 3 months (P =.001) after the intervention, but not at 6 months (P =.06). The mindfulness-based intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement in sleep quality than the sleep hygiene education group at 1 month (P =.001), 3 months (P =.001), and 6 months (P =.001) after the intervention.

METHODS: A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions. Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05).

514,"Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^\nBACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes. When asked to compare SD effects to other methods of altering consciousness, the most common answer was that SD was unique (38.4%). 25.8% reported persisting (≥ 24 h) positive effects (often described as increased sense of well-being) on at least one occasion. 4.4% reported persisting negative effects (most often anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon.

INPUT: Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^\nBACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes. When asked to compare SD effects to other methods of altering consciousness, the most common answer was that SD was unique (38.4%). 25.8% reported persisting (≥ 24 h) positive effects (often described as increased sense of well-being) on at least one occasion. 4.4% reported persisting negative effects (most often anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon. In addition to acute hallucinogenic effects, SD may produce subacute increases in subjective well-being. Such a subacute effect would be unusual for a drug that is used non-medically, as withdrawal from other drugs typically either does not affect mood or causes dysphoria. Findings from this convenience sample should be confirmed and extended using surveys of random samples and controlled clinical studies.

INPUT: The effect of age on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus.^\nBACKGROUND: The effect of age on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is not well known. METHODS: We studied 1,000 consecutive patients with AMI who were admitted to our hospital between 1990 and 1994. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to age: group 1, 20-59 years; group 2, 60-69 years; and group 3, 70 years or older. The patients were also divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of DM. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.8% in the patients without DM and 12.5% in the patients with DM. The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.8% in group 1, 8.3% in group 2, and 12.5% in group 3 in the patients without DM. The in-hospital mortality rate was 10.0% in group 1, 13.3% in group 2, and 15.0% in group 3 in the patients with DM. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients with DM than in the patients without DM in all age groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 in the patients without DM. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 1 in the patients with DM. CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients with DM than in the patients without DM in all age groups. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the elderly patients than in the younger patients in the patients without DM. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in the elderly patients than in the younger patients in the patients with DM.

612,"MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days.

INPUT: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) in healthy volunteers.^\nINTRODUCTION: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine found in a number of plant species and in the venom of the Bufo alvarius toad. It is also a component of the ayahuasca brew used in shamanic rituals in South America. The pharmacokinetics of 5-MeO-DMT have not been studied in humans. AIMS: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 5-MeO-DMT in healthy volunteers. METHODS: 5-MeO-DMT was administered orally to 12 healthy volunteers (6 males and 6 females) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The subjects were divided into 2 groups of 6, with 1 group receiving 5-MeO-DMT (0.3 mg/kg) and the other receiving placebo. The groups were then crossed over to receive the alternative treatment. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. Plasma concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 5-MeO-DMT was rapidly absorbed, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 0.5 hours. The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 0.8 ng/mL. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was 2.5 hours. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was 2.1 ng·h/mL. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 0.4 L/h/kg. There was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between males and females. CONCLUSIONS: 5-MeO-DMT is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The pharmacokinetics of 5-MeO-DMT are not significantly affected by age.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of psilocybin on cognitive and emotional measures of alcoholism in a randomized controlled trial.^\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current study examined the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on cognitive and emotional measures of alcohol use in a randomized controlled trial. Participants with AUD (N = 27) were randomized to receive a single dose of psilocybin (10 mg/70 kg) or placebo in a double-blind design. Participants were assessed at baseline, 1 week, and 3 months after the psilocybin or placebo session. The primary outcome was the percentage of days abstinent (PDA) from alcohol use. Secondary outcomes included the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ), the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), the Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale (AASE), and the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire (AEQ). The psilocybin group had a significantly greater increase in PDA from baseline to 3 months compared to the placebo group (p = 0.03). The psilocybin group also had a significantly greater decrease in AUDIT scores from baseline to 3 months compared to the placebo group (p = 0.02). There were no significant differences between the psilocybin and placebo groups on the ACQ, AUQ, AASE, or AEQ. These results suggest that a single dose of psilocybin may be an effective treatment for AUD. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and to examine the long-term effects of psilocybin on AUD.

Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions.

1054,"Prospective associations between meth/amphetamine (speed) and MDMA (ecstasy) use and depressive symptoms in secondary school students.^\nBACKGROUND: Research has raised significant concern regarding the affective consequences of synthetic drug use. However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003-2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.","***TASK***

INPUT: Prospective associations between meth/amphetamine (speed) and MDMA (ecstasy) use and depressive symptoms in secondary school students.^\nBACKGROUND: Research has raised significant concern regarding the affective consequences of synthetic drug use. However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003-2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.

INPUT: The effect of a 3-month exercise program on the physical fitness of children with Down syndrome.^\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 3-month exercise program on the physical fitness of children with Down syndrome. The subjects were 10 children with Down syndrome (mean age 9.5 years) who were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 5) or a control group (n = 5). The experimental group participated in a 3-month exercise program, which consisted of 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week. The control group did not participate in the exercise program. The physical fitness of the subjects was measured before and after the 3-month exercise program. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly greater improvements in the 50-yard dash, 50-yard run, and 50-yard walk than the control group. The experimental group also had significantly greater improvements in the 50-yard run and 50-yard walk than the control group. The results of this study suggest that a 3-month exercise program can improve the physical fitness of children with Down syndrome.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[1, 0, 0, 0]"
1109,"A voxel-based PET investigation of the long-term effects of ""ecstasy"" consumption on brain serotonin transporters.^\nObjective: Recent functional imaging studies have reported evidence of alterations in the serotonergic system induced by 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ""Ecstasy."" However, these studies have often been limited by small sample size, lack of tracer selectivity, unreliable assessment of MDMA doses, insufficiently matched comparison groups, or region-of-interest analysis. Method: Positron emission tomography (PET) using the specific serotonin transporter ligand [ 11C](+)McN5652 was performed in 117 subjects: 30 current MDMA users, 29 former MDMA users, 29 drug-naive comparison subjects, and 29 users of drugs other than MDMA (polydrug comparison subjects). Self-assessment of drug history was checked by analyzing hair samples. Local serotonin transporter availability was computed by a regularized reference tissue approach. Voxel-based comparison of serotonin transporter availability was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99). Results: Serotonin transporter availability in current MDMA users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon, thalamus, left caudate, hippocampus, occipital cortex, temporal lobes, and posterior cingulate gyrus compared with all other groups. Reduction was more pronounced in female than in male subjects. There was no significant difference of serotonin transporter availability among former MDMA users and the drug-naive and polydrug comparison subjects. A negative correlation between serotonin transporter availability and mean MDMA dose was found in occipital visual areas and in the left precentral sulcus of current MDMA users. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the serotonin transporter availability and the MDMA abstention period in brainstem and in the basal forebrain in all MDMA users. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of MDMA-induced protracted alterations of the serotonergic system and indicate that the reduced availability of serotonin transporter, as measured by PET, might be reversible.

Preliminary evidence suggests that intravenous ketamine has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, making it a candidate with therapeutic potential for depressed patients at risk for suicide. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI), as well as their respective onset and duration of action. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to September 29, 2022. Study Eligibility Criteria: We conducted a systematic review of all parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect and duration of ketamine or esketamine on SI. Our primary outcome measure was the Suicide Scale score, which was measured using the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), or Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI). To obtain effect sizes (Cohen’s d), we calculated the difference in Suicide Scale scores before and after administration in each group. Results: Our study showed that intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine had a significant anti-SI effect. Specifically, ketamine produced a large degree of anti-SI effect within the 4–6 hours (Cohen’s d = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.81) and a medium-large degree in the 24 hours (Cohen’s d = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.41).

The rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine has been shown to reduce suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with TRD has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single intravenous dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo in 80 patients with TRD. The primary outcome was the change in the total score on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) from baseline to 24 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes included the change in the total score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) from baseline to 24 hours after treatment. Results: The mean change in the SSI total score from baseline to 24 hours after treatment was significantly greater in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (mean difference, -3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.4 to -0.6; P =.02). The mean change in the MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after treatment was significantly greater in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (mean difference, -6.0; 95% CI, -9.8 to -2.2; P =.003).

1455,"Effects of Low-Dose Ketamine on the Antidepressant Efficacy and Suicidal Ideations in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nOBJECTIVES: It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05).

The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the electroencephalogram in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anesthetic agent for over 40 years. It has also been used as a recreational drug and is a potential drug of abuse. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp electrodes in 10 healthy volunteers before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered intravenously. The EEG was analyzed using the fast Fourier transform and the EEG power spectrum was calculated. The EEG power spectrum was analyzed in the frequency bands delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz).

1806,"A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ibogaine on the expression of genes involved in the opioid system in the rat brain.^\nIbogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of opioid addiction. The mechanism of action of ibogaine is not fully understood, but it is known to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin. Ibogaine also has a high affinity for the opioid receptor. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ibogaine on the expression of genes involved in the opioid system in the rat brain. Rats were treated with a single dose of ibogaine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. The expression of genes involved in the opioid system was measured in the brain using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that ibogaine significantly increased the expression of the mu-opioid receptor gene (MOR) in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. Ibogaine also significantly increased the expression of the delta-opioid receptor gene (DOR) in the nucleus accumbens. The expression of the kappa-opioid receptor gene (KOR) was not significantly affected by ibogaine.

Substance use expectancies are assumed to be an essential component in explaining substance use behaviour and, therefore, the development of effective substance use prevention and treatment strategies. Method: Dutch young adults with an online interest in drug-related social media posts were targeted with an online survey about their use of alcohol and drugs. This resulted in a convenience sample (N = 4182, 73.4% female, M<sub>age</sub> = 21.11), of which 35.5% had used ecstasy at least once in their life and 29.3% had used ecstasy last year. Latent class analyses were used to identify subgroups based on both positive and negative expectancies of ecstasy use. Cross-class differences were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Results: This study yielded four distinct classes: only negative expectancies (13.6%), high positive and negative expectancies (23.5%), low to moderate positive and negative expectancies (20.6%), and mostly positive expectancies (22.4%). These classes differed significantly in lifetime experience with ecstasy use, intention to use ecstasy, perception of harmfulness and availability, and social norms regarding the use of ecstasy. Conclusion: Findings show that ecstasy use expectancies can be used to create meaningful classes of users and non-users, and that these classes are different enough to warrant varied prevention approaches.

Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 12 schools in the Netherlands. The intervention consisted of a 1-year PA program, including a PA curriculum, a PA policy, and a PA environment. The control group received no intervention. PA was measured with accelerometers at baseline and after 1 year. The primary outcome was the percentage of adolescents who met the PA guidelines. Secondary outcomes were the total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and sedentary time. Results: A total of 1,003 adolescents (mean age 13.2 years, 51% girls) were included. The percentage of adolescents who met the PA guidelines was 16.5% at baseline and 16.7% after 1 year in the intervention group and 16.7% at baseline and 16.8% after 1 year in the control group.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design. Participants listened to music in a quiet room before and after drug administration. The music was presented in a random order, and participants rated their subjective experience of the music on a number of dimensions. MDMA increased ratings of ""stimulated,"" ""energetic,"" ""alert,"" ""happy,"" ""elated,"" ""euphoric,"" ""loved the music,"" and ""liked the music"" and decreased ratings of ""bored,"" ""dull,"" ""tired,"" and ""uninterested."" MDMA also increased ratings of ""stimulated"" and ""energetic"" in response to music that was rated as ""boring"" before drug administration. MDMA did not affect ratings of ""stimulated"" or ""energetic"" in response to music that was rated as ""interesting"" before drug administration. These results suggest that MDMA increases the subjective experience of music, particularly for music that is not initially rated as interesting.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 1, 0, 0]"
1990,"LSD-induced changes in the functional connectivity of distinct thalamic nuclei.^\nThe role of the thalamus in mediating the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was recently proposed in a model of communication and corroborated by imaging studies. However, a detailed analysis of LSD effects on nuclei-resolved thalamocortical connectivity is still missing. Here, in a group of healthy volunteers, we evaluated whether LSD intake alters the thalamocortical coupling in a nucleus-specific manner. Structural and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired in a placebo-controlled study on subjects exposed to acute LSD administration. Structural MRI was used to parcel the thalamus into its constituent nuclei based on individual anatomy. Nucleus-specific changes of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity were mapped using a seed-based approach. LSD intake selectively increased the thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral complex, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei. Functional coupling was increased between these nuclei and sensory cortices that include the somatosensory and auditory networks. The ventral and pulvinar nuclei also exhibited increased FC with parts of the associative cortex that are dense in serotonin type 2A receptors. These areas are hyperactive and hyper-connected upon LSD intake. At subcortical levels, LSD increased the functional coupling among the thalamus's ventral, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei, but decreased the striatal-thalamic connectivity.

2105,"Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","***TASK***

2301,"Long-term outcomes of psychoactive drug use in trauma patients: A multicenter patient-reported outcomes study.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychoactive drug use (PDU) is reported in up to 40% of trauma patients and is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications. However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

INPUT: The effect of a 12-week exercise program on the physical fitness of children with cerebral palsy.^\nA 12-week exercise program was conducted with 10 children with cerebral palsy (CP) to determine the effect of the program on their physical fitness. The program consisted of 12 weeks of exercise training, 3 times a week, for 60 minutes each session. The exercise program included aerobic exercise, strength training, and stretching. The physical fitness of the children was measured before and after the exercise program. The results showed that the children's physical fitness improved significantly after the exercise program. The children's aerobic capacity, measured by the 6-minute walk test, increased by 20.5% (p < 0.05). The children's strength, measured by the 30-second sit-to-stand test, increased by 17.5% (p < 0.05). The children's flexibility, measured by the sit-and-reach test, increased by 12.5% (p < 0.05). The children's balance, measured by the single-leg stance test, increased by 10.5% (p < 0.05). The children's agility, measured by the 4 x 10-meter shuttle run test, increased by 12.5% (p < 0.05). The children's speed, measured by the 10-meter sprint test, increased by 10.5% (p < 0.05). The children's endurance, measured by the 1-minute sit-up test, increased by 12.5% (p < 0.05). The children's coordination, measured by the 8-foot up-and-go test, increased by 10.5% (p < 0.05). The children's overall physical fitness, measured by the Physical Fitness Test, increased by 12.5% (p < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that a 12-week exercise program can improve the physical fitness of children with CP. The exercise program can be used as a tool to improve the physical fitness of children with CP. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.

2912,"Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents.","***TASK***

2957,"Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

INPUT: Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is sensitive to the effects of antidepressant medication. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) intravenously. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP (p = 0.001) and decreased the latency of the P300 ERP (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have a direct effect on the P300 ERP. The P300 ERP may be a useful tool for investigating the neurophysiological effects of ketamine in patients with depression. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT#00088699.

3661,"Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study.^\nBackground: Previous studies employing retrospective assessments methods found that regular ecstasy users frequently use alcohol, marihuana and other drugs in combination with ecstasy. Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a ""natural history"" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use. Confirmation of these findings awaits further advances in the application of ecological momentary assessment methodologies. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.","***TASK***

INPUT: Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study.^\nBackground: Previous studies employing retrospective assessments methods found that regular ecstasy users frequently use alcohol, marihuana and other drugs in combination with ecstasy. Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a ""natural history"" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use. Confirmation of these findings awaits further advances in the application of ecological momentary assessment methodologies. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

INPUT: The effect of age on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus.^\nBACKGROUND: The effect of age on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is not well known. METHODS: We studied 1,000 consecutive patients with AMI who were admitted to our hospital between 1990 and 1995. Of these, 200 patients had DM. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to age: group 1, < 50 years; group 2, 50-59 years; group 3, 60-69 years; and group 4, > or = 70 years. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% in group 1, 6.7% in group 2, 10.0% in group 3, and 20.0% in group 4 (p < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.3% in patients without DM and 10.0% in patients with DM (p < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% in patients without DM and 20.0% in patients with DM in group 4 (p < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.3% in patients without DM and 10.0% in patients with DM in group 3 (p < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.7% in patients without DM and 6.7% in patients with DM in group 2 (p = 0.99). The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% in patients without DM and 4.5% in patients with DM in group 1 (p = 0.99).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the personality and mental health of healthy volunteers.^\n5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine that has been used in traditional shamanic rituals for centuries. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the personality and mental health of healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The participants were assessed before and after the administration of the drug using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the scores on the Harm Avoidance and Self-Directedness scales of the TCI, and significantly decreased the scores on the SCL-90-R. These findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may have a positive effect on the personality and mental health of healthy volunteers. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to investigate the long-term effects of 5-MeO-DMT.

Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^\nBACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists produce a broad range of symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of endogenous psychoses, particularly schizophrenia and dissociative states.","***TASK***

The available treatments are not effective in all patients, and there is a significant need for more effective treatment options. Here we present the protocol for an investigator-initiated and publicly funded trial of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for MDD. This single-site, open-label study investigates the proof of principle and safety of MDMA-AT in participants with MDD and provides an initial impression of treatment effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 12 participants [>18 years] with DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD will receive a flexible dose of MDMA in a therapeutic setting on two dosing days over a 4 week period preceded by three preparatory sessions. Each MDMA dosing session will be followed by three integration sessions. The primary outcome is change in MDD symptom severity, as measured by the mean change in MADRS scores from Baseline to 8 weeks after the second MDMA session. The secondary outcome is change in functional impairment, as evaluated by the mean change in Sheehan Disability Scale scores from Baseline to 8 weeks after the second MDMA session. Safety measures include vital signs, the incidence of Adverse Events and suicidality as measured by the Colombia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. DISCUSSION: This proof of principle trial will inform the development of fully powered clinical trials, optimize the protocol for the administration of MDMA-AT in participants with MDD and explore uncertainties including barriers to recruitment, retention and acceptability of MDMA-AT as a treatment for MDD.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of a novel, extended-release formulation of methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the efficacy of methylphenidate in children with ADHD is limited by its short duration of action. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel, extended-release formulation of methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) in children with ADHD. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. Children (aged 6-12 years) with ADHD were randomized to receive OROS-MPH (18 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline to endpoint in the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score. Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS-R), and the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised (CTRS-R). Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and laboratory tests. RESULTS: A total of 120 children were randomized to receive OROS-MPH (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60). The mean change from baseline to endpoint in the ADHD-RS-IV total score was significantly greater in the OROS-MPH group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The mean change from baseline to endpoint in the CGI-I score was significantly greater in the OROS-MPH group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The mean change from baseline to endpoint in the CPRS-R and CTRS-R scores was significantly greater in the OROS-MPH group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The most common AEs were headache, decreased appetite, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: OROS-MPH was effective and well tolerated in children with ADHD. CLINICAL TRIAL IDENTIFICATION: NCT00102860.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin on cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers measured using arterial spin labeling: a phase I randomized controlled study.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction. The mechanism of action of psilocybin is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve 5-HT2A receptor activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Healthy volunteers (n = 12) were randomized to receive either psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or placebo. CBF was measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) at baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after drug administration. RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased CBF in the left and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left and right insula at 1 hour after drug administration. CBF in the left and right ACC and the left insula remained significantly increased at 2 hours after drug administration. CBF in the left and right ACC and the left insula returned to baseline levels at 3 hours after drug administration. CBF in the right insula remained significantly increased at 4 hours after drug administration. CBF in the left and right ACC and the left and right insula returned to baseline levels at 5 and 6 hours after drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of psilocybin significantly increased CBF in the ACC and insula in healthy volunteers.

Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, has been used to probe glutamatergic function in normal and schizophrenic volunteers. These studies and others have provided data consistent with a putative involvement of a glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia; however, these studies have also raised concerns about the distress inflicted on patients, the potential for adverse events, and the serious long-term effects that could possibly be induced by symptom-simulating action. METHODS: For all patient volunteers (n = 30) who participated in these studies, we reviewed the acute safety during and in the immediate postketamine administration. Patients available for long-term follow-up (n = 25) were matched to a group of patients (n = 25) who participated in research but did not receive ketamine. We compared their long-term outcome in terms of psychopathology, the need for psychiatric care, and the amount of antipsychotic medication required for optimal therapeutic response. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events in more than 90 ketamine interviews. Distress to patients was minimal, which is shown by the lack of anxiety ratings. Over a mean follow-up period of 8 months, we found no differences between patients who did and did not receive ketamine on any measures of psychopathology, psychiatric care, or the amount of antipsychotic medication.

OBJECTIVES: We employed receptor-enriched analysis of functional connectivity by targets (REACT) to explore differences in functional connectivity (FC) associated with the distributions of the primary targets of LSD-the 5HT(1a), 5HT(1b), 5HT(2a), D1 and D2 receptors. METHODS: We performed secondary analyses of an openly available dataset (N = 15) to estimate the LSD-induced alterations in receptor-enriched FC maps associated with these systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed as a dimension reduction strategy for subjective experiences associated with LSD captured by the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire. Correlations between these principal components as well as VAS ratings of subjective effects with receptor-enriched FC were explored. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, LSD produced differences in FC when the analysis was enriched with each of the primary serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. Altered receptor-enriched FC showed relationships with the subjective effects of LSD on conscious experience, with serotonergic and dopaminergic systems being predominantly associated with perceptual effects and perceived selfhood as well as cognition respectively.

Methods Ten participants were randomised to receive a 96-h ketamine infusion, titrated as tolerated to a target rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h, while 10 received a 40-min ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg). Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6 mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion. Most participants tolerated the infusion well, with minimal psychotomimetic symptoms or blood pressure elevation despite achieving high ketamine concentrations (mean 424 ng/ml for 96-h arm, 156 ng/ml for 40-min arm). There was no rebound hypertension upon discontinuing clonidine. Rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in both study groups. Higher ketamine concentration was associated with sustained antidepressant response, and was not with greater psychotomimetic side effects, in the 96-h arm.

5680,"Intravenous ketamine relieves pain and depression after traumatic suicide attempts: A case series.^\nThe letter presents a series of cases where, after traumatic suicide attempts, authors administered intravenous doses of ketamine to decrease pain and acute suicidal thoughts. The first case is an 81-year-old man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted neck laceration and left wrist laceration. On initial psychiatric consultation, it was discovered that the patient had been holding a delusional belief that he and his wife were developing dementia. After discussion with the patient, family, and surgical specialists, it was decided that the patient was not medically stable for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and pharmacotherapy was initiated to target symptoms of depression and psychosis using venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and aripiprazole on hospital day 3. The second case is also an elderly man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted bilateral orbit trauma. The treatment team decided to start him on venlafaxine and mirtazapine with a rapid titration to doses of 225 mg and 30 mg, respectively. In this set of 2 cases, we have provided strong evidence of the utility of intravenous ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and suicidal ideation after traumatic suicide attempts. This combines the traditional use of ketamine as an anesthetic with newly discovered antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. In these 2 cases, symptom relief was the desired outcome of treatment, and by this metric, the use of ketamine was a success in these patients in terms of management of pain, depression, and suicidality. Of note, both patients in this series were elderly and diagnosed as having MDD with psychotic features. These patients did not have any exacerbation of psychosis and rather appeared to lessen these symptoms, possibly by exerting treatment of their underlying depression.

The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and 40 minutes after drug administration. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. The effect of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing was assessed using a region of interest analysis. Ketamine significantly reduced the intensity of negative emotions expressed by the faces. This was associated with a significant reduction in the activation of the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. There was no significant effect of ketamine on the activation of the insula or the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings suggest that the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine may be mediated by a reduction in the neural response to negative emotions.

Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group.

INPUT: The safety and efficacy of {+/-}3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study.^\nCase reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.

5928,"Evidence that subanesthetic doses of ketamine cause sustained disruptions of NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontoparietal connectivity in humans.^\nFollowing the discovery of the antidepressant properties of ketamine, there has been a recent resurgence in the interest in this NMDA receptor antagonist. Although detailed animal models of the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine’s effects have emerged, there are few MEG/EEG studies examining the acute subanesthetic effects of ketamine infusion in man. We recorded 275 channel MEG in two experiments (n = 25 human males) examining the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion. MEG power spectra revealed a rich set of significant oscillatory changes compared with placebo sessions, including decreases in occipital, parietal, and anterior cingulate alpha power, increases in medial frontal theta power, and increases in parietal and cingulate cortex high gamma power. Each of these spectral effects demonstrated their own set of temporal dynamics. Dynamic causal modeling of frontoparietal connectivity changes with ketamine indicated a decrease in NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontal-to-parietal connectivity. AMPA-mediated connectivity changes were sustained for up to 50 min after ketamine infusion had ceased, by which time perceptual distortions were absent. The results also indicated a decrease in gain of parietal pyramidal cells, which was correlated with participants’ self-reports of blissful state. Based on these results, we suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may depend on its ability to change the balance of frontoparietal connectivity patterns.

6232,"Effects of Repeated Psilocybin Dosing in OCD.^\nAim 1: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms among participants in the immediate treatment condition, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment condition. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the immediate treatment group will report statistically significantly greater symptom improvement from baseline 4 days post‐second dose, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment group at the same interval during their waitlist phase. Aim 2: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, compared to one dose. The investigators hypothesize that two doses of oral psilocybin will reduce OCD symptoms to a statistically significantly greater extent than one dose. This study aims to investigate the effects of repeated dosing of oral psilocybin on OCD symptomatology and assess psychological mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's therapeutic effects on OCD. This study will employ a randomized, waitlist‐controlled design with blinded independent ratings, with participants randomized to receive either immediate treatment (two doses oral psilocybin separated by one week) or delayed treatment (7 weeks post‐randomization). An adaptive dose selection strategy will be implemented, with the first dose being standardized at 25 mg of psilocybin, and the second dose being either the same or a higher dosage (i.e., 30 mg) on the basis of a clinically significant response from baseline or not, respectively, 4 days post‐first dose. This study is conducted entirely on an outpatient basis with the possibility of remote/virtual follow‐up visits after each dosing session.

INPUT: Effects of Repeated Psilocybin Dosing in OCD.^\nAim 1: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms among participants in the immediate treatment condition, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment condition. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the immediate treatment group will report statistically significantly greater symptom improvement from baseline 4 days post‐second dose, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment group at the same interval during their waitlist phase. Aim 2: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, compared to one dose. The investigators hypothesize that two doses of oral psilocybin will reduce OCD symptoms to a statistically significantly greater extent than one dose. This study aims to investigate the effects of repeated dosing of oral psilocybin on OCD symptomatology and assess psychological mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's therapeutic effects on OCD. This study will employ a randomized, waitlist‐controlled design with blinded independent ratings, with participants randomized to receive either immediate treatment (two doses oral psilocybin separated by one week) or delayed treatment (7 weeks post‐randomization). An adaptive dose selection strategy will be implemented, with the first dose being standardized at 25 mg of psilocybin, and the second dose being either the same or a higher dosage (i.e., 30 mg) on the basis of a clinically significant response from baseline or not, respectively, 4 days post‐first dose. This study is conducted entirely on an outpatient basis with the possibility of remote/virtual follow‐up visits after each dosing session. The dosing sessions last the entire day, and participants will be medically cleared prior to being permitted to return home with assistance (e.g., driven by a family member or friend, or ride share).

INPUT: The effect of age on the development of the human brain.^\nThe human brain is the most complex organ in the body. It is also the most vulnerable to the effects of aging. The brain is composed of billions of neurons, which are connected by synapses. As we age, the number of synapses decreases, and the connections between neurons become weaker. This can lead to a decline in cognitive function, such as memory and problem-solving skills. The brain is also affected by the accumulation of plaques and tangles, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. These changes can lead to a decline in cognitive function, such as memory and problem-solving skills.

6496,"Effects of low-dose ketamine on neuropathic pain: An electroencephalogram-electrooculogram/behavioral study.^\nThe aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low-dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.","***TASK***

6629,"Trends in drug use among electronic dance music party attendees in New York City, 2016-2019.^\nOBJECTIVE: Electronic dance music (EDM) party attendees are a high-risk population for drug use and associated adverse effects. We examined trends in past-year drug use within this population to better inform prevention and harm reduction efforts. METHODS: Each summer from 2016 through 2019, we used time-space sampling to survey a cross-section of adults entering EDM parties at randomly selected nightclubs and at dance festivals in New York City. Ns ranged from 504 (2019) to 1,087 (2016). We estimated log-linear trends in past-year use of 16 different synthetic drugs or drug classes. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, estimated past-year prevalence of use of ketamine increased from 5.9% to 15.3% (a 157.6% relative increase; P = .007), LSD use increased from 9.9% to 16.6% (a 67.7% relative increase, P < .001), powder cocaine use increased from 17.3% to 35.2% (a 103.5% relative increase, P < .001), and GHB use increased from 1.0% to 4.2% (a 311.8% relative increase; P = .002).

METHODS: We studied 1,000 consecutive patients with AMI who were admitted to the coronary care unit of a tertiary care hospital. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those with DM (n = 200) and those without DM (n = 800). The patients were further divided into 2 age groups: those younger than 60 years (n = 400) and those 60 years or older (n = 600). The outcome of AMI was assessed in terms of in-hospital mortality, complications, and length of hospital stay.

7077,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study.","***TASK***

The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression: a randomised controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation is a common symptom of depression and a major risk factor for suicide. We aimed to assess the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Research Center in Bethesda, MD, USA. We enrolled patients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression (defined as a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score of 20 or more and a score of 2 or more on the MADRS item assessing suicidal ideation). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0·5 mg/kg) or placebo. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated randomisation sequence, with a block size of four, and was stratified by sex. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was change in the MADRS item assessing suicidal ideation from baseline to 24 h after treatment. We did a modified intention-to-treat analysis, including all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of the primary outcome. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00737460. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2009, and Dec 31, 2010, we enrolled 68 patients, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to receive ketamine and 34 to receive placebo. 33 patients in the ketamine group and 32 in the placebo group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The mean change in the MADRS item assessing suicidal ideation from baseline to 24 h after treatment was -1·4 (SD 1·2) in the ketamine group and -0·2 (1·1) in the placebo group (mean difference -1·2, 95% CI -1·8 to -0·6; p=0·0002). The most common adverse events were headache, dizziness, nausea, and dissociation. INTERPRETATION: A single dose of intravenous ketamine significantly reduced suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. These findings suggest that ketamine might be a useful treatment for suicidal ideation in patients with depression.

Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ecstasy on the subjective experience of music. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 males, 10 females) were recruited for this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg/kg of ecstasy or placebo. The subjective experience of music was assessed using the Music Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) before and 2 h after drug administration. Results: The MEQ scores were significantly higher after ecstasy than after placebo. The MEQ scores were also significantly higher after ecstasy than before drug administration. Conclusion: A single dose of ecstasy enhances the subjective experience of music.

8578,"The external validity of results derived from ecstasy users recruited using purposive sampling strategies.^\nThis study sought to compare the patterns and correlates of 'recent' and 'regular' ecstasy use estimated on the basis of two datasets generated in 2001 in New South Wales, Australia, from a probability and a non-probability sample. The first was the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), a multistage probability sample of the general population; and the second was the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) Party Drugs Module, for which regular ecstasy users were recruited using purposive sampling strategies. NDSHS recent ecstasy users (any use in the preceding 12 months) were compared on a range of demographic and drug use variables to NDSHS regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 12 months) and purposively sampled regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 6 months). The demographic characteristics of the three samples were consistent. Among all three, the mean age was approximately 25 years, and a majority (60%) of subjects were male, relatively well-educated, and currently employed or studying. Patterns of ecstasy use were similar among the three samples, although compared to recent users, regular users were likely to report more frequent use of ecstasy. All samples were characterised by extensive polydrug use, although the two samples of regular ecstasy users reported higher rates of other illicit drug use than the sample of recent users. The similarities between the demographic and drug use characteristics of the samples are striking, and suggest that, at least in NSW, purposive sampling that seeks to draw from a wide cross-section of users and to sample a relatively large number of individuals, can give rise to samples of ecstasy users that may be considered sufficiently representative to reasonably warrant the drawing of inferences relating to the entire population.

8810,"Quitting ecstasy: An investigation of why people stop taking the drug and their subsequent mental health.^\nThe regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.","***TASK***

Methods: Participants were respondents aged ≥ 12 years (N = 1,006,051) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2002–2019. Predictors were continuous years. Outcomes included illicit use of peyote, mescaline, psilocybin, ketamine, salvia, and tryptamine. Sociodemographic variables (gender; age; race/ethnicity; educational level; family income) were modeled as covariates. Trends were estimated overall and by age (12–17, 18–25, 26+). Prevalence differences [PDs] were obtained for each category, along with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]. Results: Increases in lifetime use were observed for psilocybin (2002–2019 PD=+1.61), tryptamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.55; 2015–2019 PD=+0.44), and ketamine (2006–2014 PD=+0.27; 2015–2019 PD=+0.21).

INPUT: The effect of a 3-month exercise program on the quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.^\nBackground: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease that affects the quality of life of patients. Exercise training is one of the most important non-pharmacological treatments for COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 3-month exercise program on the quality of life of patients with COPD. Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design. The statistical population of this study included all patients with COPD who referred to the pulmonary clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz in 2019. The sample size was 30 patients with COPD who were selected by convenience sampling method. The data collection tool was the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (paired t-test and independent t-test) in SPSS software version 22. Results: The results showed that the mean score of the quality of life of patients with COPD before the intervention was 62.5±12.5 and after the intervention was 48.5±11.5. The results of the paired t-test showed that the mean score of the quality of life of patients with COPD before and after the intervention was significantly different (P<0.001). The results of the independent t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the mean score of the quality of life of patients with COPD before and after the intervention in terms of age, gender, education, marital status, and occupation (P>0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the 3-month exercise program had a significant effect on the quality of life of patients with COPD.

We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of multitasking on psychological stress reactivity in recreational users of cannabis and MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is associated with psychobiological and neurocognitive deficits.

INPUT: The effects of a 12-week exercise program on the physical fitness of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a 12-week exercise program on the physical fitness of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Twenty-four children with ADHD (mean age 9.5 years) were randomly assigned to an exercise group (n=12) or a control group (n=12). The exercise group participated in a 12-week exercise program, which included 3 sessions per week of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise. The control group did not participate in the exercise program. The physical fitness of the children was assessed before and after the 12-week exercise program. RESULTS: The exercise group showed significant improvements in the 20-m shuttle run test (p<0.05), the 50-m shuttle run test (p<0.05), the 1-minute sit-up test (p<0.05), and the 1-minute push-up test (p<0.05). The control group showed no significant changes in any of the physical fitness tests.

9119,"A systematic review of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health: An evaluation of the current wave of research and suggestions for the future.^\nResearch on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research. Despite promising results, further work is needed to determine which psychedelic is best suited for diverse mental health conditions, the most appropriate type of psychotherapy to employ, and the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying clinical benefits.

9151,"LSD, afterglow and hangover: Increased episodic memory and verbal fluency, decreased cognitive flexibility.^\nPsychedelics acutely impair cognitive functions, but these impairments decline with growing experiences with psychedelics and microdoses may even exert opposing effects. Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity, this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub-acutely change cognition. For this, we applied a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or an inactive placebo. Sub-acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing, including memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF; 2D Object-Location Memory Task, OLMT; Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, RAVLT), verbal fluency (phonological; semantic; switch), design fluency (basic; filter; switch), cognitive flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST), sustained and switching attention (Trail Making Test, TMT), inhibitory control (Stroop Task) and perceptual reasoning (Block Design Test, BDT). The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index (BMI) and abstinence period from psychedelics, LSD sub-acutely improved visuospatial memory (ROCF immediate recall points and percentage, OLMT consolidation percentage) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility (WCST: fewer categories achieved; more perseveration, errors and conceptual level responses).

INPUT: The effect of age on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus.^\nBACKGROUND: The effect of age on the outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is not well known. METHODS: We studied 1,000 consecutive patients with AMI who were admitted to our hospital between 1990 and 1995. Of these, 200 patients had DM. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to age: group 1, < or = 50 years; group 2, 51-60 years; group 3, 61-70 years; and group 4, > or = 71 years. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% in group 1, 6.7% in group 2, 10.0% in group 3, and 20.0% in group 4 (P < 0.001). The 1-year mortality rate was 6.7% in group 1, 10.0% in group 2, 13.3% in group 3, and 26.7% in group 4 (P < 0.001). The 1-year mortality rate was significantly higher in group 4 than in group 1 (P < 0.05). The 1-year mortality rate was significantly higher in group 4 than in group 3 (P < 0.05). The 1-year mortality rate was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 2 (P < 0.05). The 1-year mortality rate was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of AMI in patients with DM is worse than that in patients without DM. The outcome of AMI in patients with DM is worse in older patients than in younger patients. The outcome of AMI in patients with DM is worse in patients aged > or = 71 years than in patients aged 61-70 years. The outcome of AMI in patients with DM is worse in patients aged 61-70 years than in patients aged 51-60 years.

9381,"Intraoperative ketamine for reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common mental disease happens in perinatal period. Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time. In recent years, ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study trail, healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9% saline) or placebo (5 ml of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms, which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) score of pain at 2 days postpartum. This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR1900022464. RESULTS: Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019, 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated: 165 (50%) to the ketamine group and 165 (50%) to the placebo group. There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum (13.1% vs. 22.6%, respectively; p = .029). However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p = .209) and 1 month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = .319). The NRS score of wound pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.0 ± 1.0, respectively; p < .001) and uterine contraction pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.1 ± 0.9, respectively; p < .001) was lower in the ketamine group at 2 days postpartum compared with placebo group. The prevalence of headache, hallucination, and dizziness was higher in the ketamine group than the placebo group during the operation.

However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p = .209) and 1 month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = .319). The NRS score of wound pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.0 ± 1.0, respectively; p < .001) and uterine contraction pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.1 ± 0.9, respectively; p < .001) was lower in the ketamine group at 2 days postpartum compared with placebo group. The prevalence of headache, hallucination, and dizziness was higher in the ketamine group than the placebo group during the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Operative intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg) can reduce the postpartum depressive symptoms for 1 week. The long-time effect is remained to be seen.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on postoperative pain and morphine consumption after abdominal hysterectomy.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an analgesic adjunct in the perioperative period. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on postoperative pain and morphine consumption after abdominal hysterectomy. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy were randomly allocated to receive either ketamine 0.5 mg/kg or saline 1 mL/kg intravenously before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 μg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 0.8% to 1.2% in 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Morphine consumption was recorded at 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS: The VAS scores were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group at 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after surgery (P <.05). The total morphine consumption was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg before induction of anesthesia reduces postoperative pain and morphine consumption after abdominal hysterectomy.
