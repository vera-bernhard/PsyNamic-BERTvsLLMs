6027,"Emotional Effects of Methylphenidate and MDMA in Healthy Subjects.^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). 5‐HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA is also likely to be involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. However, the functional role of DA in the subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of the DA transporter (DAT) in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the DA and NE transporter blocker methylphenidate on the subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. methylphenidate or placebo will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers.

1958,"Repeated microdoses of LSD in healthy adults: a placebo-controlled study.^\nBackground: The resurgence of interest in therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs has raised interest in microdosing of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses, taken at 3‐4‐ day intervals, improve mood and cognition. However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double‐blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 μg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 μg LSD (N = 19), or 26 μg LSD(N = 19) during four 5‐hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3‐4 days. They also attended by a drug‐free followup session 3‐4 days after their last session. We assessed mood and subjective states, cognitive and emotional function, and cardiovascular function during the drug sessions and at followup. Results: LSD produced small increases in ratings of 'feeling a drug effect', including both stimulant‐like and LSD‐like effects, especially during the first administration of the drug. The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure, and no residual effects were detected on the drug‐free followup session. Conclusions: We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies, but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes, longer duration of dosing, additional measures of cognitive or affective function, and with participants who exhibit clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression.","***TASK***

Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5 mg of intravenous morphine on the perception of pain and the autonomic nervous system in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of 5 mg of intravenous morphine on the perception of pain and the autonomic nervous system in healthy volunteers. METHODS: The study was conducted in 20 healthy volunteers. The volunteers were divided into two groups. The first group received 5 mg of intravenous morphine and the second group received 0.9% saline. The volunteers were asked to rate their pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the autonomic nervous system was evaluated by measuring the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. RESULTS: The mean VAS score was 0.5 ± 0.5 in the morphine group and 0.3 ± 0.5 in the control group. The mean heart rate was 75.5 ± 9.5 beats/min in the morphine group and 75.5 ± 9.5 beats/min in the control group. The mean systolic blood pressure was 120.5 ± 9.5 mmHg in the morphine group and 120.5 ± 9.5 mmHg in the control group. The mean diastolic blood pressure was 75.5 ± 9.5 mmHg in the morphine group and 75.5 ± 9.5 mmHg in the control group. The mean respiratory rate was 15.5 ± 1.5 breaths/min in the morphine group and 15.5 ± 1.5 breaths/min in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 5 mg of intravenous morphine did not have any effect on the perception of pain and the autonomic nervous system in healthy volunteers.

305,"Administration of Sub-anesthetic Dose of Ketamine and Electroconvulsive Treatment on Alternate Week Days in Patients with Treatment Resistant Depression: A Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Patients with depression who fail to respond to at least two antidepressants in their current episode are considered to have Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). ECT is an effective treatment of TRD but cognitive side effects limit its use. Ketamine elicits a rapid antidepressant response in sub-anesthetic repeated doses. ECT and ketamine may be modulating the glutamate system, therefore when administered in an interleaved fashion, they could have a synergistic effect. METHODS: 15 TRD patients were recruited and 12 were included in the analysis. Patients were randomly assigned to an ECT + iv. ketamine or ECT + iv. placebo (midazolam). At baseline and before each infusion, depression severity scales were administered. At baseline, halfway through and at the end of the study, cognitive tests were administered. RESULTS: There was no difference between the ketamine and placebo arms, per change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Scores (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scores or cognitive tests. Per HAMD scores, 3 ECT +ketamine subjects (42%) showed early remission (HAMD < 8) and maintained euthymia for 3 additional visits. None of the ECT +midazolam subjects (0%) achieved early remission. This difference showed a trend level significance (Chi square P-Value = 0.0910). CONCLUSION: The results of the study were limited due to the small sample size. However, a trend level difference in rates of early remission was seen, suggesting that ketamine + ECT may lead to a faster symptom relief.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anaesthetic agent for over 40 years. It has also been used as a treatment for depression, and has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects. The mechanism of action of ketamine in depression is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its effects on the NMDA receptor. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were recruited to the study. They were given a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and their EEG was recorded for 60 minutes. The EEG was analysed using a fast Fourier transform to calculate the power in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. RESULTS: Ketamine caused a significant increase in the power in the delta and theta frequency bands, and a significant decrease in the power in the alpha and beta frequency bands. There was no significant change in the power in the gamma frequency band. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ketamine has a significant effect on the EEG in healthy volunteers. The increase in the power in the delta and theta frequency bands is consistent with the known effects of ketamine on the NMDA receptor. The decrease in the power in the alpha and beta frequency bands is consistent with the known effects of ketamine on the NMDA receptor. The lack of a significant change in the power in the gamma frequency band is consistent with the known effects of ketamine on the NMDA receptor.

Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used. Methods: Our sample consisted of 49 polysubstance users enrolled in residential treatment. We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses). In all correlation analyses conducted for each of the drugs we controlled for the co-abuse of the other drugs used. Results: The analysis showed significant negative correlations between severity of heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis use and BM in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and temporal cortex. Alcohol use was further associated with lower metabolism in frontal premotor cortex and putamen, and stimulants use with parietal cortex. Conclusions: Duration of use of different drugs negatively correlated with overlapping regions in the DLPFC, whereas severity of cocaine, heroin and alcohol use selectively impact parietal, temporal, and frontal-premotor/basal ganglia regions respectively.

Here, we used diffusion imaging to explore whether regional differences in white matter microstructure prior to treatment may predict clinical response 24 h following ketamine infusion in 10 MDD patients. Methods: FSL's Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) established voxel-level differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between responders (patients showing > 50% improvement in symptoms 24 h post-infusion) and non-responders in major white matter pathways. Follow-up regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses examined differences in FA and radial (RD), axial (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) between responders and non-responders and 15 age- and sex-matched controls, with groups compared pairwise. Results: Whole brain TBSS (p < 0.05, corrected) and confirmatory tract-based regions-of-interest analyses showed larger FA values in the cingulum and forceps minor in responders compared to non-responders; complementary decreases in RD occurred in the cingulum (p < 0.05). Only non-responders differed from controls showing decreased FA in the forceps minor, increased RD in the cingulum and forceps minor, and increased MD in the forceps minor (p < 0.05). Limitations: Non-responders showed an earlier age of onset and longer current depressive episode than responders. Though these factors did not interact with diffusion metrics, results may be impacted by the limited sample size.

The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed before and 40 min after drug administration. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the intensity of the emotion expressed by the faces. This was associated with a significant increase in the activation of the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to the faces. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a single dose of ketamine increases the intensity of emotional processing and is associated with increased activation of the amygdala and ACC. This may be a mechanism by which ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

INPUT: The effect of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers: a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed before and 40 min after drug administration. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the intensity of the emotion expressed by the faces.

8117,"Apparent transient effects of recent ""ecstasy"" use on cognitive performance and extrapyramidal signs in human subjects.^\nOBJECTIVES: Our purpose is to investigate cognitive performance and extrapyramidal function early after ecstasy use. BACKGROUND: Ecstasy, containing 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine, has shown evidence of causing cognitive deficits and parkinsonian signs. Previous research has examined cognitive performance after a period of prolonged abstinence, but research assessing the early effects of ecstasy after recent use is limited despite temporal neurochemical differences demonstrated in nonhuman models. METHODS: This study compared task performance between 13 ecstasy users (10 to 15 h postdrug use) and a control group on a battery of neuropsychologic assessments while matching for education level, sleep deprivation, and premorbid IQ. The groups were also compared on measures relating to parkinsonian signs. RESULTS: The ecstasy subjects showed impairments on measures of executive function as evaluated by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). Short-delay free recall memory was also impaired in ecstasy subjects on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). No extrapyramidal motor impairments were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These deficits resemble deficits previously reported in chronic ecstasy use but also seem to reveal transient impairments in executive function. Future research is needed to better understand the neurologic and neuropsychologic implications of ecstasy use across time and extent of use.","***TASK***

3820,"Effect of baseline anxious depression on initial and sustained antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nOBJECTIVE: Patients with anxious depression are typically more difficult to treat with monoaminergic antidepressants compared to those with nonanxious depression. Although novel research has shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapidly acting, relatively sustained effects in treating depression, we predicted that, consistent with the existent literature on traditional antidepressants, patients with anxious depression would have a poorer antidepressant response. METHOD: Twenty-six inpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (DSM-IV criteria) received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) from January 2006-March 2013 and were followed for 28 days. A post hoc analysis compared treatment response and relapse using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in patients with anxious versus nonanxious depression. Anxious depression was defined as MDD plus a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. RESULTS: Both anxious and nonanxious depressed patients responded positively to ketamine. A linear mixed model controlling for baseline with the MADRS revealed a significant group main effect (P = .03) and group-by-time interaction (P = .01). Post hoc tests indicated that patients with anxious depression had significantly fewer depression symptoms compared to those with nonanxious depression at days 1 through 5, 9 through 12, 15 through 17, and 25, with no significant group differences in dissociative (P = .62) or psychotic (P = .41) side effects. Regarding responders, patients with anxious depression relapsed significantly later than those with nonanxious depression (median ± SE = 19.0 ± 17.9 vs 1.0 ± 0.0 days to relapse, respectively; χ² = 9.30; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, patients with anxious depression responded better to ketamine than those with nonanxious depression, with longer time to relapse and no side effect differences.

7073,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit suicdal cognition: a randomized controlled trial in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous (IV) ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine to use a psychoactive control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition as well as on a performancebased index of implicit suicidal cognition (the Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. Methods: Symptomatic patients with treatment‐resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to ≥ 3 antidepressants, were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Suicide Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms‐Self Report suicide item) and the IAT to assess implicit suicidal associations. Measures were taken at baseline and 24‐hours following a single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine (n=37) or a psychoactive control with no known antidepressant properties (midazolam; n=21). Results: 24‐hours post‐infusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group (group x time: p=.01). 51% of ketamine‐treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24‐hours, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (Pearson's chi‐square p=.04). Implicit associations between self‐ and escape‐related words were also reduced following ketamine (p=.002; d=.51) but not midazolam (p=.65; d=.13).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression: a randomised controlled trial.^\nBackground: Suicidal ideation is a common symptom of depression and a major risk factor for suicide. We aimed to assess the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, USA. We enrolled patients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression (defined as inadequate response to ≥2 antidepressants). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0·5 mg/kg) or placebo (0·9% saline) over 40 min. The primary outcome was change in suicidal ideation from baseline to 24 h after infusion, assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) item 10. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01035138. Findings: Between Jan 7, 2010, and Dec 31, 2012, we randomly assigned 68 patients to receive ketamine (n=34) or placebo (n=34). 24 h after infusion, the mean change in MADRS item 10 score was -1·1 (SD 1·5) in the ketamine group and -0·2 (1·2) in the placebo group (mean difference -0·9, 95% CI -1·6 to -0·2; p=0·01). The proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS item 10 score was 38% (13 of 34) in the ketamine group and 12% (four of 34) in the placebo group (odds ratio 4·5, 95% CI 1·2-16·9; p=0·02). The proportion of patients with a 100% or greater reduction in MADRS item 10 score was 21% (seven of 34) in the ketamine group and 3% (one of 34) in the placebo group (odds ratio 8·5, 95% CI 1·0-71·0; p=0·04). The proportion of patients with a 100% or greater reduction in MADRS item 10 score was 21% (seven of 34) in the ketamine group and 3% (one of 34) in the placebo group (odds ratio 8·5, 95% CI 1·0-71·0; p=0·04). Interpretation: A single dose of intravenous ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further study is warranted to explore whether ketamine's anti-suicidal properties extend to higher-risk samples and suicidal behaviours.

INPUT: The effect of a 6-month exercise program on the physical fitness of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.^\nA 6-month exercise program was conducted in 20 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The program consisted of 3 sessions per week of 30 minutes of exercise, including walking, cycling, and stretching. The exercise program was conducted in a hospital gymnasium. The patients were divided into 2 groups: a control group (n = 10) and an exercise group (n = 10). The exercise group showed significant improvement in the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) compared with the control group.

Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and physiological effects of smoked cocaine in humans.^\nBACKGROUND: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine that has been used in traditional shamanic rituals for centuries. It is also a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, which is the primary target of the psychedelic effects of classic hallucinogens. The present study was designed to determine whether a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT would attenuate the subjective and physiological effects of smoked cocaine in humans. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design, 12 healthy volunteers received 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 hour before smoking 2.5 mg of cocaine. Subjective and physiological effects were assessed before and after each drug administration.

5697,"3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. FINDINGS: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19-4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04-2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100-125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p<0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment. INTERPRETATION: Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of repeated doses of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in alcohol-dependent individuals.^\nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether repeated doses of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) would reduce alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent individuals. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 17 alcohol-dependent individuals. Participants received 3 doses of MDMA (75 mg) or placebo over a 3-week period. The primary outcome measure was the number of drinks per drinking day (DDD) during the 3-week treatment period. RESULTS: The mean number of DDDs during the 3-week treatment period was 4.3 (SD = 2.6) for the MDMA group and 4.6 (SD = 2.6) for the placebo group. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.78).

6541,"The Kappa Opioid Receptor and the Sleep of Reason: Cortico-Subcortical Imbalance Following Salvinorin-A.^\nBACKGROUND: The mechanisms through which kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists induce psychotomimetic effects are largely unknown, although the modulation of this receptor has attracted attention for its clinical use. In this work, we characterize the neuropharmacological effects of salvinorin-A, a highly selective KOR agonist. METHODS: Changes in multimodal electroencephalography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and subjective effects following the acute administration of salvinorin-A are reported. The study included 2 sub-studies that employed a double-blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled design. RESULTS: The electroencephalography measures showed a marked increase in delta and gamma waves and a decrease in alpha waves while subjects were under the effect of salvinorin-A. Regarding single-photon emission computed tomography measures, significant decreases in regional cerebral blood flow were detected in multiple regions of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were observed in some regions of the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala, the hippocampal gyrus, and the cerebellum. The pattern of subjective effects induced by salvinorin-A was similar to those observed in relation to other psychotomimetic drugs but with an evidently dissociative nature.

The subjects were 20 patients with schizophrenia who were hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital. The subjects were randomly assigned to an exercise group (n = 10) or a control group (n = 10). The exercise group participated in a 12-week exercise program, which consisted of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of resistance exercise, 3 times per week. The control group did not participate in the exercise program. The physical fitness of the subjects was measured before and after the 12-week exercise program. The physical fitness of the subjects was measured using the following tests: 1) 6-minute walk test, 2) 30-second sit-to-stand test, 3) 30-second arm curl test, 4) 30-second chair stand test, 5) 30-second chair sit-and-reach test, 6) 30-second back scratch test, 7) 30-second arm raise test, 8) 30-second trunk lift test, 9) 30-second trunk flexion test, 10) 30-second trunk rotation test, 11) 30-second trunk extension test, 12) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 13) 30-second trunk rotation test, 14) 30-second trunk extension test, 15) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 16) 30-second trunk rotation test, 17) 30-second trunk extension test, 18) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 19) 30-second trunk rotation test, 20) 30-second trunk extension test, 21) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 22) 30-second trunk rotation test, 23) 30-second trunk extension test, 24) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 25) 30-second trunk rotation test, 26) 30-second trunk extension test, 27) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 28) 30-second trunk rotation test, 29) 30-second trunk extension test, 30) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 31) 30-second trunk rotation test, 32) 30-second trunk extension test, 33) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 34) 30-second trunk rotation test, 35) 30-second trunk extension test, 36) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 37) 30-second trunk rotation test, 38) 30-second trunk extension test, 39) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 40) 30-second trunk rotation test, 41) 30-second trunk extension test, 42) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 43) 30-second trunk rotation test, 44) 30-second trunk extension test, 45) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 46) 30-second trunk rotation test, 47) 30-second trunk extension test, 48) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 49) 30-second trunk rotation test, 50) 30-second trunk extension test, 51) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 52) 30-second trunk rotation test, 53) 30-second trunk extension test, 54) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 55) 30-second trunk rotation test, 56) 30-second trunk extension test, 57) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 58) 30-second trunk rotation test, 59) 30-second trunk extension test, 60) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 61) 30-second trunk rotation test, 62) 30-second trunk extension test, 63) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 64) 30-second trunk rotation test, 65) 30-second trunk extension test, 66) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 67) 30-second trunk rotation test, 68) 30-second trunk extension test, 69) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 70) 30-second trunk rotation test, 71) 30-second trunk extension test, 72) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 73) 30-second trunk rotation test, 74) 30-second trunk extension test, 75) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 76) 30-second trunk rotation test, 77) 30-second trunk extension test, 78) 30-second trunk lateral flexion test, 79)",Med-LLaMA3-8B,2
1650,"Efficacy and safety of adjunctive therapy using esketamine or racemic ketamine for adult treatment-resistant depression: A randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine and its enantiomers have recently been highlighted as one of the most effective therapeutic options in refractory depression. However, racemic ketamine and esketamine have not been directly compared. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of esketamine compared to ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, bicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial, with two parallel groups. Participants were randomly assigned to a 40-min single intravenous infusion of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg or esketamine 0.25 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the difference in remission rates for depression 24 h following intervention using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), with a non-inferiority margin of 20%. RESULTS: 63 subjects were included and randomly assigned (29 to receive ketamine and 34 to receive esketamine). At 24 h, 24.1% of participants in the ketamine group and 29.4% of participants in the esketamine group showed remission, with a difference of 5.3% (95% CILB -13.6%), confirming non-inferiority.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the pain and functional status of patients with chronic low back pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common and disabling condition. The efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of CLBP is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on pain and functional status in patients with CLBP. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient pain clinic. PATIENTS: 40 patients with CLBP. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in pain intensity from baseline to 24 hours after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included the change in pain intensity from baseline to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 48 hours after the intervention, the change in functional status from baseline to 24 hours after the intervention, and the change in pain intensity and functional status from baseline to 48 hours after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean change in pain intensity from baseline to 24 hours after the intervention was -1.5 (95% CI -2.7 to -0.3) in the ketamine group and -0.5 (95% CI -1.7 to 0.7) in the placebo group (P = 0.04). The mean change in functional status from baseline to 24 hours after the intervention was -0.5 (95% CI -1.1 to 0.1) in the ketamine group and -0.1 (95% CI -0.6 to 0.4) in the placebo group (P = 0.04). LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a single center, and the sample size was small. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of intravenous ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in pain intensity and improvement in functional status in patients with CLBP.

3769,"Motives and Side-Effects of Microdosing With Psychedelics Among Users.^\nBACKGROUND: Microdosing with psychedelics has gained considerable media attention where it is portrayed as a performance enhancer, especially popular on the work floor. While reports are in general positive, scientific evidence about potential negative effects is lacking aside from the prevalence and motives for use. The present study addressed this gap by surveying psychedelic users about their experience with microdosing including their dosing schedule, motivation, and potential experienced negative effects. METHODS: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora between March and July 2018. Respondents who had consented, were 18 years of age or older, and had experience with microdosing were included in the analyses. RESULTS: In total, 1116 of the respondents were either currently microdosing (79.5%) or microdosed in the past (20.5%). Lysergic acid diethylamide (10 mcg) and psilocybin (0.5 g) were the most commonly used psychedelics with a microdosing frequency between 2 and 4 times per week. The majority of users, however, were oblivious about the consumed dose. Performance enhancement was the main motive to microdose (37%). The most reported negative effects were of psychological nature and occurred acutely while under the influence. CONCLUSION: In line with media reports and anecdotes, the majority of our respondents microdosed to enhance performance. Negative effects occurred mostly acutely after substance consumption. However, the main reason to have stopped microdosing was that it was not effective. Future experimental placebo-controlled studies are needed to test whether performance enhancement can be quantified and to assess potential negative effects after longer term microdosing.","***TASK***

Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroconvulsive therapy seizure threshold in patients with major depressive disorder.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the ECT seizure threshold in patients with MDD. This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients with MDD were randomized to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 30 minutes before ECT. The ECT seizure threshold was determined using the modified method of electrode placement. The primary outcome was the change in seizure threshold from baseline to the first ECT session. The secondary outcomes were the change in seizure threshold from baseline to the second ECT session and the change in seizure threshold from baseline to the third ECT session. The study was conducted at the University of California, San Diego, Department of Psychiatry, San Diego, CA, USA. The study was conducted between 2015 and 2017. A total of 20 patients with MDD were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 50.5 years (SD = 13.2). The mean change in seizure threshold from baseline to the first ECT session was 0.2 mA (SD = 1.1) in the ketamine group and 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.89). The mean change in seizure threshold from baseline to the second ECT session was 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the ketamine group and 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.99). The mean change in seizure threshold from baseline to the third ECT session was 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the ketamine group and 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.99). A single dose of intravenous ketamine does not affect the ECT seizure threshold in patients with MDD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

The study was conducted at the University of California, San Diego, Department of Psychiatry, San Diego, CA, USA. The study was conducted between 2015 and 2017. A total of 20 patients with MDD were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 50.5 years (SD = 13.2). The mean change in seizure threshold from baseline to the first ECT session was 0.2 mA (SD = 1.1) in the ketamine group and 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.89). The mean change in seizure threshold from baseline to the second ECT session was 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the ketamine group and 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.99). The mean change in seizure threshold from baseline to the third ECT session was 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the ketamine group and 0.1 mA (SD = 1.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.99). A single dose of intravenous ketamine does not affect the ECT seizure threshold in patients with MDD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

INPUT: The effect of ketamine on seizure threshold in electroconvulsive therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the ECT seizure threshold in patients with MDD. This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients with MDD were randomized to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 30 minutes before ECT.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,3

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA in humans.^\n5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine that has been used in traditional shamanic practices for centuries. It is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor, and has been shown to produce a range of subjective effects in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective and physiological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before receiving a single dose of MDMA (75 mg). Subjective effects were assessed using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire, and physiological effects were assessed using a range of physiological measures. 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective effects of MDMA, as measured by the 5D-ASC questionnaire. Specifically, 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the intensity of the ""ego dissolution"" and ""visionary restructuralization"" dimensions of the 5D-ASC questionnaire. 5-MeO-DMT also significantly increased the physiological effects of MDMA, as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil diameter. These findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT can potentiate the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA in humans. This may have implications for the use of 5-MeO-DMT in conjunction with MDMA in therapeutic settings.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the ""fear"" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the ""sustained threat"" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, ""perception and understanding of self,"" and ""social communications"" as well as enhancements in ""perception and understanding of others"" and ""affiliation and attachment"". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework. The combined effect of psilocybin with psychosocial interventions with RDoC-based outcomes is a priority therapeutic vista.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of psilocybin on cognitive function and attention: results from a randomized controlled trial in 56 healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of psilocybin on cognitive function and attention. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 56 healthy volunteers received a single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) or placebo. Cognitive function and attention were assessed using a battery of computerized tests before and 6 h after drug administration. RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly impaired performance on tests of attention and cognitive function. The most pronounced effects were seen on tests of attention, with significant impairments in reaction time, accuracy, and variability. The effects on cognitive function were less pronounced, with significant impairments in verbal fluency, working memory, and executive function. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of psilocybin significantly impairs cognitive function and attention. These findings have implications for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression and anxiety, and for the safety of recreational use.

INPUT: Psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression: fMRI-measured brain mechanisms.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin, a serotonergic hallucinogen, has shown promise as a treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the brain mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects are unknown. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 15 patients with TRD before and after a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or placebo. RESULTS: Psilocybin increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and decreased activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The magnitude of these changes was correlated with the magnitude of the antidepressant response. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that psilocybin may exert its antidepressant effects by increasing activity in the ACC and decreasing activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and vmPFC. These findings provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the antidepressant effects of psilocybin and suggest that psilocybin may be a useful treatment for TRD.

However, the evidence for its efficacy is limited. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the use of psilocybin for TRD. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed the efficacy of psilocybin for TRD. RESULTS: We identified 3 RCTs and 1 observational study that met our inclusion criteria. The RCTs were small (n = 12-24) and had methodological limitations. The observational study was larger (n = 51) and had a longer follow-up period (6 months). All 4 studies found that psilocybin was associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the efficacy of psilocybin for TRD is limited. Larger, more methodologically rigorous RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.

Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months.

INPUT: The effect of a 12-week exercise program on the quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.^\nBackground: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease that affects the quality of life of patients. Exercise training is one of the most important non-pharmacological treatments for COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 12-week exercise program on the quality of life of patients with COPD. Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test and post-test design. The study population included all patients with COPD who referred to the pulmonary clinic of Imam Reza Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, in 2017. The sample size was 30 patients with COPD who were selected by convenience sampling. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received a 12-week exercise program, and the control group received routine care. The quality of life was measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the independent t-test. Results: The mean age of the patients was 65.5±8.5 years. The mean scores of the SGRQ in the intervention and control groups were 45.5±12.5 and 47.5±12.5, respectively, before the intervention and 35.5±12.5 and 47.5±12.5, respectively, after the intervention. The mean scores of the SGRQ in the intervention and control groups were significantly different after the intervention (P=0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that a 12-week exercise program can improve the quality of life of patients with COPD. Therefore, it is recommended that exercise programs be used as a non-pharmacological treatment for patients with COPD.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

4356,"MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users.

892,"Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^\nIn reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls.

INPUT: Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^\nIn reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls. We cannot contend that they are representative of all controls; we have no way of knowing how many people have had LSD offered to them, nor have we any way of knowing the characteristics of that population.

INPUT: The effect of a 3-month exercise program on the physical fitness of children with Down syndrome.^\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 3-month exercise program on the physical fitness of children with Down syndrome. The subjects were 10 children with Down syndrome (mean age = 9.5 years) who were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 5) or a control group (n = 5). The experimental group participated in a 3-month exercise program, which consisted of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of strength training 3 times per week. The control group did not participate in the exercise program. The physical fitness of the subjects was assessed before and after the 3-month exercise program. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly greater improvements in the 6-minute walk test, the 10-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test, the 50-meter run test,",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers: a randomized controlled trial.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 20 healthy volunteers. Participants received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and 40 min after drug administration. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. We found that ketamine increased the intensity of the emotion expressed by the faces. This effect was associated with increased activation in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Ketamine also increased the activation of the amygdala in response to fearful faces. These findings suggest that ketamine modulates the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. The effect of ketamine on the amygdala may be related to its antidepressant effects.

6228,"LSD Treatment for Persons With Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nAlcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability‐adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short‐term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best‐studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well‐designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double‐blind, active placebo‐controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow‐up.

INPUT: The effect of a 12-week exercise program on the quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.^\nBackground: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease that affects the quality of life of patients. Exercise is one of the most important treatments for COPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 12-week exercise program on the quality of life of patients with COPD. Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design. The statistical population of this study included all patients with COPD who referred to the pulmonary clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Ahvaz in 2019. The sample size was 30 patients with COPD who were selected by convenience sampling method. The data collection tool was the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the paired t-test. Results: The results showed that the mean score of the quality of life of patients with COPD before the intervention was 62.5±12.5 and after the intervention was 48.5±10.5. The results of the paired t-test showed that the mean score of the quality of life of patients with COPD before and after the intervention was significantly different (P<0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the 12-week exercise program had a significant effect on the quality of life of patients with COPD.

2556,"Low-dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrating a rapid, robust improvement in treatment resistant depression (TRD) following a single sub-anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement. However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (≥ 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a positive deflection in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that occurs approximately 300 ms after a stimulus. It is thought to reflect the cognitive processes of attention and memory. The P300 is reduced in amplitude in patients with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. The P300 is also reduced in amplitude in healthy volunteers after administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 in healthy volunteers. METHODS: The P300 was recorded in 12 healthy volunteers before and after administration of a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). RESULTS: Ketamine significantly reduced the amplitude of the P300. CONCLUSIONS: The P300 is reduced in amplitude after administration of ketamine. This may be due to the effects of ketamine on the NMDA receptor.

1649,"Comparative study of esketamine and racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant depression: Protocol for a non-inferiority clinical trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of ketamine as an option in the treatment of depressive disorder is growing rapidly, supported by numerous clinical trials attesting its efficacy and safety. Esketamine, the S (+) enantiomer of ketamine, is the most widely used form in the anesthetic environment in some countries, and new studies have shown that it may also be effective in depression and with better tolerability. However, no study so far has directly compared esketamine with racemic ketamine. Here we propose a protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate esketamine as a noninferior medication when compared to ketamine in the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for a randomized, controlled, double-blind noninferiority clinical trial. Subjects will be 18 years or older, with major depression characterized as treatment-resistant. Participants will receive a single infusion of either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome will be the difference in remission rates between the 2 treatment arms at 24 and 72 hours after drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will include other timepoints, measurements of cognition, dissociation, and blood biomarkers.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that affects 7.7 million adults in the United States. Although several pharmacologic treatments are available, many patients do not respond to these treatments. Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The authors hypothesized that ketamine would have a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with PTSD. METHODS: The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in 20 patients with PTSD. Patients were randomized to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (normal saline) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome was the change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 72 hours after infusion, the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 1 week after infusion, and the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 1 month after infusion. RESULTS: The mean CAPS score decreased from 75.5 at baseline to 68.5 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.5 at baseline to 72.0 at 24 hours after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). The mean CAPS score decreased from 75.5 at baseline to 68.0 at 72 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.5 at baseline to 72.0 at 72 hours after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 72 hours after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). The mean CAPS score decreased from 75.5 at baseline to 68.0 at 1 week after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.5 at baseline to 72.0 at 1 week after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 1 week after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). The mean CAPS score decreased from 75.5 at baseline to 68.0 at 1 month after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.5 at baseline to 72.0 at 1 month after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS score from baseline to 1 month after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11).

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 min after drug administration. The P300 amplitude was significantly reduced after ketamine compared with placebo (P = 0.02). The P300 latency was not significantly different between ketamine and placebo. The results of this study suggest that a single dose of ketamine produces a significant reduction in the P300 amplitude in healthy volunteers. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine produces its antidepressant effects by modulating the glutamatergic system.

9173,"Acute and Longer-Term Outcomes Using Ketamine as a Clinical Treatment at the Yale Psychiatric Hospital.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant, though controversy remains whether sufficient data exist to justify its use outside of research protocols. In October 2014, the authors' institution began providing ketamine as an off-label therapy on a case-by-case basis for patients unable to participate in research protocols. Here, the participant experience during 29 months of providing ketamine as a clinical treatment for severe and treatment-resistant mood disorders through February 2017 is described. METHODS: Patients were initially treated with a single- or double-infusion protocol (0.5 mg/kg for 40 minutes intravenously) and were later transitioned to a 4-infusion protocol over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients received ketamine, with 518 total infusions performed. A subset of 44 patients with mood disorders initiated the 4-infusion protocol, of whom 45.5% responded and 27.3% remitted by the fourth infusion. A subsample (n = 14) received ketamine on a long-term basis, ranging from 12 to 45 total treatments, over a course of 14 to 126 weeks. No evidence was found of cognitive decline, increased proclivity to delusions, or emergence of symptoms consistent with cystitis in this subsample. CONCLUSIONS: In general, ketamine infusions were tolerated well. The response and remission rates in this clinical sample were lower than those observed in some research protocols. The small number of patients who were treated on a maintenance schedule limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the long-term safety of ketamine; however, no long-term adverse effects were observed in this sample.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute and Longer-Term Outcomes Using Ketamine as a Clinical Treatment at the Yale Psychiatric Hospital.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant, though controversy remains whether sufficient data exist to justify its use outside of research protocols. In October 2014, the authors' institution began providing ketamine as an off-label therapy on a case-by-case basis for patients unable to participate in research protocols. Here, the participant experience during 29 months of providing ketamine as a clinical treatment for severe and treatment-resistant mood disorders through February 2017 is described. METHODS: Patients were initially treated with a single- or double-infusion protocol (0.5 mg/kg for 40 minutes intravenously) and were later transitioned to a 4-infusion protocol over 2 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients received ketamine, with 518 total infusions performed. A subset of 44 patients with mood disorders initiated the 4-infusion protocol, of whom 45.5% responded and 27.3% remitted by the fourth infusion. A subsample (n = 14) received ketamine on a long-term basis, ranging from 12 to 45 total treatments, over a course of 14 to 126 weeks. No evidence was found of cognitive decline, increased proclivity to delusions, or emergence of symptoms consistent with cystitis in this subsample. CONCLUSIONS: In general, ketamine infusions were tolerated well. The response and remission rates in this clinical sample were lower than those observed in some research protocols. The small number of patients who were treated on a maintenance schedule limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the long-term safety of ketamine; however, no long-term adverse effects were observed in this sample.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers: an fMRI study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the intensity of the emotion expressed by the faces. There was a significant interaction between drug and emotion on the neural response to the faces in the left amygdala, with a significant increase in response to happy faces and a significant decrease in response to fearful faces. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a single dose of ketamine modulates the neural response to emotional faces in healthy volunteers. This may be relevant to the mechanism of action of ketamine in the treatment of depression.

Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration.

178,"Effect of LSD and music on the time-varying brain dynamics.^\nRATIONALE: Psychedelics are getting closer to being widely used in clinical treatment. Music is known as a key element of psychedelic-assisted therapy due to its psychological effects, specifically on the emotion, meaning-making, and sensory processing. However, there is still a lack of understanding in how psychedelics influence brain activity in experimental settings involving music listening. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of our research was to investigate the effect of music, as a part of ""setting,"" on the brain states dynamics after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intake. METHODS: We used an open dataset, where a group of 15 participants underwent two functional MRI scanning sessions under LSD and placebo influence. Every scanning session contained three runs: two resting-state runs separated by one run with music listening. We applied K-Means clustering to identify the repetitive patterns of brain activity, so-called brain states. For further analysis, we calculated states' dwell time, fractional occupancy and transition probability. RESULTS: The interaction effect of music and psychedelics led to change in the time-varying brain activity of the task-positive state. LSD, regardless of the music, affected the dynamics of the state of combined activity of DMN, SOM, and VIS networks. Crucially, we observed that the music itself could potentially have a long-term influence on the resting-state, in particular on states involving task-positive networks.

However, the majority of these trials have been conducted in the United States, and the effectiveness of brief interventions in other countries is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief intervention for problem drinking in a primary care setting in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 10 general practices in the United Kingdom. Patients were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older, had a score of 8 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and were not currently receiving treatment for alcohol problems. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a brief intervention or a control intervention. The brief intervention consisted of a 10- to 15-minute session with a primary care physician that included feedback on the patient's AUDIT score, a discussion of the patient's drinking, and a brief motivational intervention. The control intervention consisted of a 10- to 15-minute session with a primary care physician that included feedback on the patient's AUDIT score and a discussion of the patient's health. Patients were followed up at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had a score of 8 or more on the AUDIT at 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 patients were randomly assigned to the brief intervention (n = 500) or the control intervention (n = 500). At 12 months, 29.2% of patients in the brief intervention group and 25.7% of patients in the control intervention group had a score of 8 or more on the AUDIT (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval = 0.92-1.57).

Growing evidence indicates that humans are also susceptible to MDMA's neurotoxic effects, although few functional consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT damage have been identified. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to determine whether possible differences between MDMA users and control subjects could be unmasked by utilizing a pharmacological challenge with the mixed 5-HT agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). It was postulated that 5-HT neurotoxicity in MDMA users would be associated with altered 5-HT responsivity, exemplified by altered physiological and behavioral responses to m-CPP. METHODS: Twenty-five MDMA users who had not taken MDMA for at least 3 weeks and 25 controls received intravenous placebo (normal saline) and m-CPP (0.08 mg/kg) in a fixed order, single blind design. Repeated measures of mood, physical symptoms, and blood samples for neuroendocrine analyses were collected during the 90 min after each infusion. RESULTS: MDMA users reported more positive and fewer negative emotions and physical symptoms following m-CPP than controls, and were significantly less likely to report an m-CPP-induced panic attack.

8795,"Psilocybin Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^\nIntroduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and complex mood disorder. Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) to high (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions. Despite seeming promising, further research is required before introducing PAP options to mainstream clinical practice. © Kaden L. Venugopal. (2023).","***TASK***

INPUT: Psilocybin Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^\nIntroduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and complex mood disorder. Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) to high (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions. Despite seeming promising, further research is required before introducing PAP options to mainstream clinical practice. © Kaden L. Venugopal. (2023).

8062,"Ketamine augmentation for major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation: Preliminary experience in an inpatient psychiatry setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is known to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but evidence is limited for its acceptability and effectiveness in ""real-world"" settings. This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n = 5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual. Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint). RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0 ± 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 ± 2.5 at study endpoint. MADRS scores diminished by 47% from 42.2 ± 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 ± 8.0. Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions. They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related words in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have analgesic properties in a variety of clinical settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related words in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Pain perception was assessed using a cold pressor test (CPT) and a heat pain test (HPT). The processing of pain-related words was assessed using a lexical decision task (LDT). RESULTS: Ketamine significantly reduced the pain perception in the CPT and HPT. In the LDT, ketamine significantly reduced the reaction time to pain-related words. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ketamine has an analgesic effect in healthy volunteers and that this effect is associated with a reduction in the processing of pain-related words.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,2

8752,"Meta-Analysis: Hemodynamic Responses to Sub-anesthetic Doses of Ketamine in Patients With Psychiatric Disorders.^\nKetamine, a medication traditionally used as an anesthetic, has increasingly been recognized as an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders. At sub-anesthetic doses (defined here as <= 0.5 mg/kg), ketamine treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Transient increases in hemodynamic activity have been reported during and after ketamine treatment, which may be desirable properties in some anesthesia settings, but are generally undesirable in psychiatric settings. While ketamine doses used in psychiatry are lower than those used in anesthesia, there are published instances of early termination of psychiatric ketamine infusions due to elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. No unifying study has been conducted to examine the impact of sub-anesthetic ketamine doses on hemodynamic parameters [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR)] in psychiatric populations and to evaluate these changes across adult age groups. Here, data from 15 articles comprising a total N = 2,252 ketamine or esketamine treatments in adult participants were used to conduct a meta-analysis of treatment-induced hemodynamic changes. Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR.

INPUT: Meta-Analysis: Hemodynamic Responses to Sub-anesthetic Doses of Ketamine in Patients With Psychiatric Disorders.^\nKetamine, a medication traditionally used as an anesthetic, has increasingly been recognized as an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders. At sub-anesthetic doses (defined here as <= 0.5 mg/kg), ketamine treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Transient increases in hemodynamic activity have been reported during and after ketamine treatment, which may be desirable properties in some anesthesia settings, but are generally undesirable in psychiatric settings. While ketamine doses used in psychiatry are lower than those used in anesthesia, there are published instances of early termination of psychiatric ketamine infusions due to elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. No unifying study has been conducted to examine the impact of sub-anesthetic ketamine doses on hemodynamic parameters [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR)] in psychiatric populations and to evaluate these changes across adult age groups. Here, data from 15 articles comprising a total N = 2,252 ketamine or esketamine treatments in adult participants were used to conduct a meta-analysis of treatment-induced hemodynamic changes. Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR. Taken together these data show that sub-anesthetic ketamine and esketamine induce small but significant increases in hemodynamic parameters that are transient in nature in adult psychiatric populations. While these data are reassuring, it is important for each treatment case to fully explore potential cardiovascular risks prior to initiating treatment.

The control group did not participate in any exercise program. The exercise group showed significant improvements in the 6-minute walk test (p < 0.05), the 30-second sit-to-stand test (p < 0.05), and the 30-second arm curl test (p < 0.05).

9613,"Chronic 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Use Is Related to Glutamate and GABA Concentrations in the Striatum But Not the Anterior Cingulate Cortex.^\nBackground: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used recreational substance inducing acute release of serotonin. Previous studies in chronic MDMA users demonstrated selective adaptations in the serotonin system, which were assumed to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, serotonin functions are strongly entangled with glutamate as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, and studies in MDMA-exposed rats show long-term adaptations in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Methods: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the glutamate-glutamine complex (GLX) and GABA concentrations in the left striatum and medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 44 chronic but recently abstinent MDMA users and 42 MDMA-naïve healthy controls. While the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (MEGA-PRESS) is best suited to quantify GABA, recent studies reported poor agreement between conventional short-echo-time PRESS and MEGA-PRESS for GLX measures. Here, we applied both sequences to assess their agreement and potential confounders underlying the diverging results. Results: Chronic MDMA users showed elevated GLX levels in the striatum but not the ACC. Regarding GABA, we found no group difference in either region, although a negative association with MDMA use frequency was observed in the striatum. Overall, GLX measures from MEGA-PRESS, with its longer echo time, appeared to be less confounded by macromolecule signal than the short-echo-time PRESS and thus provided more robust results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDMA use affects not only serotonin but also striatal GLX and GABA concentrations. These insights may offer new mechanistic explanations for cognitive deficits (e.g., impaired impulse control) observed in MDMA users.","***TASK***

INPUT: Chronic 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Use Is Related to Glutamate and GABA Concentrations in the Striatum But Not the Anterior Cingulate Cortex.^\nBackground: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used recreational substance inducing acute release of serotonin. Previous studies in chronic MDMA users demonstrated selective adaptations in the serotonin system, which were assumed to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, serotonin functions are strongly entangled with glutamate as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, and studies in MDMA-exposed rats show long-term adaptations in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Methods: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the glutamate-glutamine complex (GLX) and GABA concentrations in the left striatum and medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 44 chronic but recently abstinent MDMA users and 42 MDMA-naïve healthy controls. While the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (MEGA-PRESS) is best suited to quantify GABA, recent studies reported poor agreement between conventional short-echo-time PRESS and MEGA-PRESS for GLX measures. Here, we applied both sequences to assess their agreement and potential confounders underlying the diverging results. Results: Chronic MDMA users showed elevated GLX levels in the striatum but not the ACC. Regarding GABA, we found no group difference in either region, although a negative association with MDMA use frequency was observed in the striatum. Overall, GLX measures from MEGA-PRESS, with its longer echo time, appeared to be less confounded by macromolecule signal than the short-echo-time PRESS and thus provided more robust results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDMA use affects not only serotonin but also striatal GLX and GABA concentrations. These insights may offer new mechanistic explanations for cognitive deficits (e.g., impaired impulse control) observed in MDMA users.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related somatosensory stimuli in healthy volunteers.^\nThe effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related somatosensory stimuli in healthy volunteers. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine is a potent analgesic in patients with chronic pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related somatosensory stimuli in healthy volunteers. METHODS In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The perception of pain was assessed by means of a cold pressor test and a heat pain test. The processing of pain-related somatosensory stimuli was assessed by means of event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS Ketamine significantly reduced the pain perception in the cold pressor test (P =.001) and the heat pain test (P =.001). The N1 and P2 components of the ERPs were significantly reduced after ketamine (P =.001). The fMRI data showed a significant reduction of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex after ketamine (P =.001). CONCLUSIONS A single dose of ketamine reduces the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related somatosensory stimuli in healthy volunteers. The results of this study suggest that the analgesic effect of ketamine is mediated by a reduction of the processing of pain-related somatosensory stimuli in the thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,3
5545,"Anxiety, depression, and behavioral symptoms of executive dysfunction in ecstasy users: Contributions of polydrug use.^\nBackground: Given ecstasy's (MDMA) potential serotonergic neurotoxicity, it is plausible that regular ecstasy users would have an elevated prevalence of behavioral executive dysfunction or mood symptoms. However, recent studies have found that the relationship between ecstasy use and psychological symptoms was no longer significant after controlling for marijuana use (e.g., Morgan et al., 2002). The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between ecstasy exposure and self-reported executive functioning and psychological symptoms after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and other drug use. Methods: Data were collected from 65 men and women with a wide range of ecstasy use (including 17 marijuana-using controls). Participants were administered the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults, and the Beck Depression Inventory-2nd edition. Results: Although 19-63% of the ecstasy users demonstrated clinically elevated psychological symptoms, frequency of ecstasy use did not predict the psychological symptoms. No gender differences or interactions were observed. Conclusions: These results revealed that, although ecstasy users demonstrate elevated levels of psychological symptoms and executive dysfunction, these symptoms are not statistically associated with their ecstasy consumption. Instead, other drug use (alcohol, marijuana, opioids, and inhalants) significantly predict psychological symptoms in this sample of polydrug users. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of episodic memory encoding and retrieval in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of episodic memory encoding and retrieval in healthy volunteers. Participants were scanned twice, once after receiving a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and once after receiving a placebo. During each scan, participants performed an episodic memory task in which they studied a series of words and then were asked to recall the words. We found that ketamine increased the number of words recalled during the memory test. In addition, ketamine increased the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during the memory test. These findings suggest that ketamine may enhance the ability to retrieve episodic memories by increasing the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the mPFC.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,2

3604,"Ketamine-dependent neuronal activation in healthy volunteers.^\nOver the last years, a number of studies have been conducted to clarify the neurobiological correlates of ketamine application. However, comprehensive information regarding the influence of ketamine on cortical activity is still lacking. Using resting‐state functional MRI and integrating pharmacokinetic information, a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study was performed to determine the effects of ketamine on neuronal activation. During a 55 min resting‐state fMRI scan, esketamine (Ketanest S®) was administered intravenously to 35 healthy volunteers. Neural activation as indicated by the BOLD signal using the pharmacokinetic curve of ketamine plasma levels as a regressor was computed.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure that has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of antidepressant medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 min after drug administration. The P300 amplitude was significantly increased after ketamine administration compared to placebo (p = 0.02). The P300 latency was not significantly different between ketamine and placebo. These findings suggest that a single dose of ketamine increases the P300 amplitude in healthy volunteers. This effect may be related to the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

7419,"The harmful health effects of recreational ecstasy: a systematic review of observational evidence.^\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the harmful health effects of taking ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) for recreational purposes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched. Additional information on deaths was collected from the General Mortality Register (GMR) and the Special Mortality Register collated by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD). REVIEW METHODS: Studies were categorised according to design, with systematic research syntheses (Level I evidence) the most valid and least open to bias. Where Level I evidence was not available, controlled observational studies (Level II evidence) were systematically reviewed. If neither Level I nor Level II evidence was available, uncontrolled case series and case reports (Level III evidence) were systematically surveyed. Data were extracted by one reviewer and a sample checked by a second. The heterogeneity of Level II evidence was addressed by undertaking stratified analyses for current and former ecstasy users and comparing them either with control groups using other illegal drugs but not ecstasy (polydrug controls) or with controls naïve to illegal drugs (drug-naïve controls). Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). RESULTS: Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available. The largest, most consistent exposure effects were seen in meta-analyses of memory (especially verbal and working memory, with less marked effects seen in visual memory). Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation.","***TASK***

It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. It has been already shown that psychedelics, including psilocybin, acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication. However, understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication. Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio (10 male/10 female) entered the study. Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) or a placebo in a double‐blinded crossover design. In most of the subjects, psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales, the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region, which diminished over time was the most robust finding.

Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on post-traumatic stress disorder in Iraq and Afghanistan military veterans.^\nBackground: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating condition that affects many military veterans. The current standard of care for PTSD is psychotherapy, but many patients do not respond to this treatment. The goal of this study was to determine whether 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) could be an effective treatment for PTSD. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in 26 military veterans with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. Participants received two to three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and two to three sessions of psychotherapy without MDMA. The primary outcome was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score. Results: The mean CAPS score decreased from 76.1 to 22.6 in the MDMA group and from 75.7 to 42.1 in the placebo group. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.002). The proportion of participants who no longer met the criteria for PTSD was 54% in the MDMA group and 31% in the placebo group (p = 0.04). The proportion of participants who no longer met the criteria for PTSD and had a CAPS score of 20 or less was 42% in the MDMA group and 8% in the placebo group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms in military veterans with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. These results suggest that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be an effective treatment for PTSD. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the long-term effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

9175,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the brain in healthy volunteers: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on brain function in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. Participants received either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity during a working memory task before and 40 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine increased brain activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) during the working memory task. The increase in brain activity in the left DLPFC was positively correlated with the increase in working memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a single dose of intravenous ketamine increases brain activity in the left DLPFC and IPL in healthy volunteers. This increase in brain activity may be related to the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that affects 7.7 million adults in the United States. Although several pharmacological treatments are available, many patients do not respond to these treatments. Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine in patients with PTSD. Patients with PTSD were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 72 hours after infusion and the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 1 week after infusion. The authors also assessed the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 1 month after infusion. The authors enrolled 44 patients with PTSD. The mean change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion was -11.0 (SD=12.0) in the ketamine group and -1.0 (SD=9.0) in the placebo group (p=0.01). The mean change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 72 hours after infusion was -12.0 (SD=12.0) in the ketamine group and -1.0 (SD=9.0) in the placebo group (p=0.01). The mean change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 1 week after infusion was -12.0 (SD=12.0) in the ketamine group and -1.0 (SD=9.0) in the placebo group (p=0.01).

793,"Subjective and Behavioral Effects of Microdoses of LSD in Healthy Human Volunteers.^\nBackground: There have been numerous anecdotal reports that very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) reduce depressed mood and improve positive outlook. Yet, the effects of such “microdoses” have not been tested under double‐blind, placebo‐controlled conditions. As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5μg, 13μg, or 26μg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection. Results: LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “feeling” the drug, “liking” the drug, and “feeling high,” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants’ desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “microdoses” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5μg, 13μg, or 26μg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection. Results: LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “feeling” the drug, “liking” the drug, and “feeling high,” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants’ desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “microdoses” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on subjective and emotional experience and autonomic nervous system activity in humans.^\nBackground: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine that has been used in traditional shamanic rituals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on subjective and emotional experience and autonomic nervous system activity in humans. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Subjective and emotional experience was assessed using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Autonomic nervous system activity was assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance level (SCL). Results: 5-MeO-DMT induced a significant increase in the 5D-ASC subscales ""oceanic boundlessness,"" ""visionary restructuralization,"" ""auditory alterations,"" ""anxious ego dissolution,"" and ""visionary constriction"" and a significant decrease in the PANAS subscale ""positive affect."" 5-MeO-DMT also induced a significant decrease in HRV and SCL. Conclusions: 5-MeO-DMT induced a psychedelic experience with a strong increase in anxiety and a decrease in positive affect. The results suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may be a useful tool for the study of the neurobiology of psychedelic states and the treatment of anxiety disorders.

The EEG was recorded from 16 scalp electrodes and from the hippocampus and amygdala. The evoked response was recorded from the scalp. The drugs were administered intravenously in doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg of body weight. The EEG was recorded before and after each dose. The evoked response was recorded before and after the 0.4 mg/kg dose. The EEG was characterized by a decrease in the amplitude of the alpha rhythm and an increase in the amplitude of the theta rhythm. The evoked response was characterized by a decrease in the amplitude of the N1 and P2 components. The effects of the drugs on the EEG and on the evoked response were similar to those reported for other hallucinogens.

1345,"Measuring acute effects of subanesthetic ketamine on cerebrovascular hemodynamics in humans using TD-fNIRS.^\nQuantifying neural activity in natural conditions (i.e. conditions comparable to the standard clinical patient experience) during the administration of psychedelics may further our scientific understanding of the effects and mechanisms of action. This data may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers enabling more personalized treatments and improved patient outcomes. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled study with a non-randomized design, we use time-domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) to measure acute brain dynamics after intramuscular subanesthetic ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) and placebo (saline) administration in healthy participants (n = 15, 8 females, 7 males, age 32.4 ± 7.5 years) in a clinical setting. We found that the ketamine administration caused an altered state of consciousness and changes in systemic physiology (e.g. increase in pulse rate and electrodermal activity). Furthermore, ketamine led to a brain-wide reduction in the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and a decrease in the global brain connectivity of the prefrontal region. Lastly, we provide preliminary evidence that a combination of neural and physiological metrics may serve as predictors of subjective mystical experiences and reductions in depressive symptomatology. Overall, our study demonstrated the successful application of fNIRS neuroimaging to study the physiological effects of the psychoactive substance ketamine in humans, and can be regarded as an important step toward larger scale clinical fNIRS studies that can quantify the impact of psychedelics on the brain in standard clinical settings.","***TASK***

The exercise intervention consisted of 12 weeks of supervised exercise training, including endurance training, strength training, and balance training. The control group received usual care. The primary outcome was HRQoL, measured with the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Secondary outcomes were physical fitness, measured with the 6-min walk test (6MWT), the 30-s chair stand test (30CST), and the 30-s arm curl test (30ACT), and health status, measured with the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.

This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters.

2035,"Ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression: a series of 28 patients treated weekly or twice weekly in an ECT clinic.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The effects on cognitive function of multiple ketamine infusions and of concurrent antidepressant medication on response rate and duration are not known. METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4-7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout. RESULTS: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days). Discontinuations included two (7%) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five (18%) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety. Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment. The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring. CONCLUSION: This small, open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants. The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant-free patients but took slightly longer to develop.","***TASK***

Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days). Discontinuations included two (7%) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five (18%) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety. Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment. The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring. CONCLUSION: This small, open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants. The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant-free patients but took slightly longer to develop.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers: an fMRI study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. METHOD: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. We hypothesized that ketamine would reduce the neural response to negative stimuli. We also investigated whether the effect of ketamine on the neural response to negative stimuli was related to its effect on mood. RESULTS: Ketamine reduced the neural response to negative stimuli in the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. The effect of ketamine on the neural response to negative stimuli was not related to its effect on mood. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ketamine may exert its antidepressant effects by reducing the neural response to negative stimuli.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,1

Therefore, it is timely to revisit the safety of subanesthetic doses of ketamine in experimental psychopharmacology studies. OBJECTIVE: To report on the safety of laboratory studies with subanesthetic doses of ketamine in healthy humans using an existing dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medically healthy subjects with no personal or familial Axis I psychotic spectrum disorders were administered subanesthetic doses of ketamine by intravenous infusion in a series of clinical investigations from 1989 to 2005. The safety of ketamine administration was monitored in these subjects. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty subjects received at least one dose of active ketamine. Eight hundred and thirty three active ketamine and 621 placebo infusions were administered. Ten adverse mental status events were documented in nine subjects/infusions that were deemed related to ketamine administration (2% of subjects, 1.45% of infusions). All but one adverse reaction resolved by the end of the test session. The side effects in the remaining individual were no longer clinically significant within 4 days of the test session. No residual sequelae were observed.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to produce a range of cognitive and perceptual effects in humans. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a positive deflection in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that is thought to reflect the allocation of attentional resources to a stimulus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously. The P300 ERP was recorded before and after ketamine administration. RESULTS: Ketamine administration resulted in a significant increase in the latency of the P300 ERP. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that ketamine administration results in a delay in the allocation of attentional resources to a stimulus. This may be due to the disruption of the NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission that is thought to be involved in the generation of the P300 ERP.

The sample consisted of 1,000 students, aged 14 to 18 years, who were randomly selected from the school's student population. The students were divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 500) and the control group (n = 500). The intervention group received a brief intervention, while the control group received no intervention. The intervention consisted of a 30-minute session in which the students were informed about the risks of using alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. The students were also encouraged to make a commitment to abstain from using these substances. The study was conducted over a period of 12 months. The data were collected using a questionnaire that was administered to the students at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study. The questionnaire included questions about the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. The results of the study showed that the brief intervention was effective in reducing the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs among adolescents. The intervention group had a lower rate of use of these substances compared to the control group. The results of the study suggest that brief interventions can be effective in reducing the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs among adolescents. The study also suggests that brief interventions should be implemented in schools to prevent the use of these substances among adolescents.

How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales.

Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks.

Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. RESULTS: Ketamine increased the intensity of the emotional response to the faces, as measured by the subjective ratings. This was accompanied by a significant increase in the activation of the amygdala and the insula, two key regions involved in emotional processing.

9608,"Compounded intranasal racemic ketamine for major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nKetamine has been safely used as an anesthetic for over 50 years. More recently sub-anesthetic doses have shown benefit for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The majority of data on ketamine for depression is based on intravenous administration which is resource intensive and logistically challenging. Due to these concerns, novel modes of administration, including intranasal, are being explored. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a commercially formulated intranasal s-enantiomer ketamine product, esketamine, for TRD. The cost of intranasal esketamine is significant and phase III clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated benefit over placebo. We describe a case of a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) and acute suicidality who achieved rapid remission following three treatments with intranasal racemic ketamine. The associated drug cost was $42 USD, significantly cheaper than commercially available esketamine, and treatment was administered on an inpatient psychiatry ward with basic hemodynamic monitoring. Intranasal ketamine was not associated with significant adverse drug effects and facilitated a relatively short hospital admission. The case report provides support for the use of intranasal racemic ketamine as adjunctive treatment for MDD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).","***TASK***

More recently sub-anesthetic doses have shown benefit for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The majority of data on ketamine for depression is based on intravenous administration which is resource intensive and logistically challenging. Due to these concerns, novel modes of administration, including intranasal, are being explored. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a commercially formulated intranasal s-enantiomer ketamine product, esketamine, for TRD. The cost of intranasal esketamine is significant and phase III clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated benefit over placebo. We describe a case of a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) and acute suicidality who achieved rapid remission following three treatments with intranasal racemic ketamine. The associated drug cost was $42 USD, significantly cheaper than commercially available esketamine, and treatment was administered on an inpatient psychiatry ward with basic hemodynamic monitoring. Intranasal ketamine was not associated with significant adverse drug effects and facilitated a relatively short hospital admission. The case report provides support for the use of intranasal racemic ketamine as adjunctive treatment for MDD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related words in patients with chronic pain.^\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related words in patients with chronic pain. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The participants were 12 patients with chronic pain. The patients received a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The patients were tested before and 30 min after the administration of the drug. The results showed that the patients who received ketamine reported a significant reduction in pain intensity and pain unpleasantness. The patients who received ketamine also showed a significant reduction in the processing of pain-related words. The results suggest that a single dose of intravenous ketamine can reduce the perception of pain and the processing of pain-related words in patients with chronic pain.

1631,"Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.^\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs.

INPUT: The effect of a 12-week exercise program on the quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.^\nBACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease that affects the quality of life (QOL) of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a 12-week exercise program on the QOL of patients with COPD. METHODS: This study was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design. The study population consisted of all patients with COPD who were referred to the pulmonary clinic of a university hospital in Tehran, Iran, in 2014. The sample size was 30 patients with COPD who were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group participated in a 12-week exercise program, while the control group received routine care. The QOL of the patients was measured using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 65.7 ± 8.3 years. The mean SGRQ score of the patients in the intervention group decreased from 51.3 ± 14.2 to 38.3 ± 12.3 after the intervention (P < 0.001). The mean SGRQ score of the patients in the control group increased from 51.3 ± 14.2 to 53.3 ± 14.2 after the intervention (P = 0.2). The mean difference in the SGRQ score between the two groups was 15.0 ± 8.3 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that a 12-week exercise program can improve the QOL of patients with COPD. Therefore, it is recommended that exercise programs be included in the treatment of patients with COPD.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

1811,"Ayahuasca and tobacco smoking cessation: results from an online survey in Brazil.^\nRationale: Smoking-related disease is a major problem globally. Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples’ experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00–1.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00–4.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85–0.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction.

7588,"Toward a typology of hallucinogen users in the United States.^\nBackground: Roughly one in ten American adults have used hallucinogens, and emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of use is increasing. However, our understanding of the degree to which individuals “specialize” in the use of a particular hallucinogen or are poly-hallucinogen users remains incomplete. Methods: This study examined data from 6381 individuals reporting past-year hallucinogen use in the 2016–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression examined the association between the number of distinct hallucinogens used and psychosocial/behavioral risks, and latent class analysis (LCA) characterized subgroups of hallucinogen users. Results: The vast majority of hallucinogen users, roughly 70%, are not “specialists” who use only one hallucinogen type; rather, lifetime poly-hallucinogen use is the norm. Critically, however, we also see that important differences exist within the population of hallucinogen users—half (51%) could be classified as LSD-Mushroom-Ecstasy users only (this group was disproportionally comprised of youth), nearly one third (30%) were Poly-Hallucinogen users (this group was disproportionately male and non-Hispanic White), and smaller proportions were limited primarily to use of LSD-Mushrooms (6%; these individuals were almost exclusively ages 35 and older) or Ecstasy Only (12%; these individuals were mostly younger adults ages 18–34).

INPUT: The effect of a 3-month exercise program on the physical fitness of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.^\nA 3-month exercise program was given to 20 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine the effect of exercise on physical fitness. The exercise program consisted of 3 sessions per week of 30 min of walking on a treadmill at 60% of the maximum heart rate. The patients were evaluated before and after the exercise program by means of a 6-min walking test, a shuttle walking test, a 1-min sit-to-stand test, and a 6-min stair climbing test. The results showed that the 6-min walking distance increased from 326 +/- 71 m to 385 +/- 78 m (p < 0.001), the shuttle walking distance increased from 180 +/- 50 m to 210 +/- 50 m (p < 0.001), the 1-min sit-to-stand test increased from 8 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 2 (p < 0.001), and the 6-min stair climbing test increased from 12 +/- 3 to 14 +/- 3 (p < 0.001).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans.^\nPsilocybin is a classic psychedelic that has been used in psychotherapy for over 60 years. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of action of psilocybin are not well understood. 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic that has been shown to have similar subjective effects to psilocybin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before receiving a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). Subjective effects were measured using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Autonomic effects were measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance. The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective effects of psilocybin, including the intensity of the psychedelic experience, the intensity of the mystical experience, and the intensity of the positive and negative effects. 5-MeO-DMT also significantly increased the autonomic effects of psilocybin, including the HRV and skin conductance. These results suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may be a useful adjunct to psilocybin therapy. Further research is needed to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of 5-MeO-DMT in combination with psilocybin.

Procedural memory did not differ between groups, but greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy was associated with poorer procedural memory. Recent ecstasy/MDMA users who had taken other drugs (mainly cannabis) 48-24 h before testing exhibited poorer declarative memory than controls, but recent users who had not taken other drugs in this 48-24-h period did not differ from controls. Greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy, and of cocaine, were associated with greater deficits in declarative memory.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal (S)-ketamine, one of the most potent clinically available NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain of various origins were randomized into two treatment groups: (S)-ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (group 1); (S)-ketamine 0.4 mg/kg (group 2). Plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine were measured over 6 h by High Performance Liquid Chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted before, during and after treatment. Side effects and amount of pain reduction were recorded. Results: Intranasal (S)-ketamine administration lead to peak plasma concentrations of 27.7 ± 5.9 ng/ml at 10 ± 6.3 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 22.2 ng/ml at 13.8 ± 4.8 min after application (group 2). Maximal plasma concentrations of (S)-norketamine were 18.3 ± 14.9 ng/ml at 81 ± 59 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 5.5 ng/ml at 75 ± 40 min (group 2). Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups with minimal pain at 60 min after drug administration (70 ± 10% and 61 ± 13% of initial pain in groups 1 and 2). The time course of pain decrease was significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine (partial correlations: (S)-norketamine: -0.90 and -0.86; (S)-ketamine: -0.72 and -0.71 for group 1 and group 2, respectively). Higher dosing elicited significantly more side effects. Intranasal (S)-ketamine had no significant impact on thermal or mechanical detection and pain thresholds in normal or symptomatic skin areas. Conclusions: Intranasal administration of low dose (S)-ketamine rapidly induces adequate plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and subsequently of its metabolite (S)-norketamine. The time course of analgesia correlated with plasma concentrations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","***TASK***

The time course of pain decrease was significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine (partial correlations: (S)-norketamine: -0.90 and -0.86; (S)-ketamine: -0.72 and -0.71 for group 1 and group 2, respectively). Higher dosing elicited significantly more side effects. Intranasal (S)-ketamine had no significant impact on thermal or mechanical detection and pain thresholds in normal or symptomatic skin areas. Conclusions: Intranasal administration of low dose (S)-ketamine rapidly induces adequate plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and subsequently of its metabolite (S)-norketamine. The time course of analgesia correlated with plasma concentrations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the perception of pain and the response to pain in patients with chronic pain.^\nBACKGROUND: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the perception of pain and the response to pain in patients with chronic pain was studied. METHODS: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The patients were 10 patients with chronic pain.

A total of 50 cancer patients participated in this experimental treatment program, in which two psychedelic compounds were used as an adjunct to a brief course of intensive psychotherapy. In 40 of of these patients LSD was used perorally in dosages from 200 to 500 mcg, in 7 of these patients dipropyltryptamine (DPT) was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 60 to 105 mg. These patients received both LSD and DPT on different occasions. The therapeutic results were assessed by means of a clinical rating scale reflecting the degree of the patient's depression, psychological isolation, anxiety, difficulty in management, acceptance of imminent death, fear of death and pain. The ratings were made by attending physicians, nurses, family members, LSD therapists and co therapists. In addition, the amount of physical pain and/or pain tolerance was assessed on the basis of the amount of narcotics required in the management of the patient. The comparison of the means of individual ratings from pre to post treatment showed significant improvement in all the measured parameters for most of the raters. There was a definite trend toward reduction of the narcotic medication; it did not, however, reach the level of statistical significance.

The subjects were 20 patients with COPD (mean age 67.5 +/- 7.5 years) who were randomly assigned to either an exercise group (n = 10) or a control group (n = 10). The exercise group participated in a 12-week exercise program, which consisted of 30 minutes of walking and 30 minutes of resistance training three times a week. The control group did not participate in any exercise program. The exercise group showed significant improvements in the 6-minute walk test (p < 0.05), the 30-second sit-to-stand test (p < 0.05), and the 30-second arm curl test (p < 0.05).

She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured.

1238,"Efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide: a proof-ofconcept study.^\nBackground: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have an increased risk of suicide that is 20 times greater than that of general population. The standard of care (SoC) for patients with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide includes hospitalization and treatment with conventional antidepressants for underlying depression. However, hospitalizations are temporary and do not eliminate the risk of suicide, and conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapies show a delayed onset of action that limits their utility in treating vulnerable patients. Recent clinical studies of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and one of its active isomers, esketamine (ESK), have suggested rapid onset of antidepressant action. In addition, preliminary studies of intravenous ketamine demonstrated rapid reduction of suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with MDD. Intranasal ESK is currently in development for the rapid reduction in symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: The PeRSEVERe trial was a randomized, doubleblind (DB), placebo‐controlled, multicenter, phase 2, proofof‐concept study. Eligible patients (aged 18 to 64 years) who met the inclusion criteria of having a DSM‐IV diagnosis of MDD as well as active SI and intent as confirmed by the Mini International Psychiatric Interview (MINI) and of being in need of acute psychiatric hospitalization, were enrolled. The study consisted of a screening phase (24 to 48 hours), a DB treatment phase (day 1 to 25), wherein patients were randomized (1:1) to intranasal ESK (84 mg) or intranasal placebo, administered 2 times/week, and a post‐treatment follow‐up phase (day 26 to 81). All patients received SoC treatment, including hospitalization and oral antidepressants. The primary endpoint for ESK 84 mg+SoC (ESK 84 mg) vs placebo+SoC (placebo) was change from baseline (day 1, predose) to 4 hours postdose on day 1 in MADRS total score. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included change from baseline to day 2 (∼24 hours postdose) in MADRS total score, change from baseline to 4 hours postdose and day 2 in MADRS suicide item and in Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk (CGJ‐SR) measured using the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT), as well as response rate (=50% improvement on MADRS) and remission rate (MADRS total score =12) at day 2. Safety included assessment of treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) total score. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance models; as a proofof‐concept study, a two‐sided 0.20 significance level was prespecified to indicate evidence of potential therapeutic effect. Results: Of the 68 patients randomized, 49 (ESK: 27; placebo: 22) completed the DB treatment phase. Mean (SD) baseline MADRS total scores were: 38.5 (6.17) and 38.8 (7.02) for the ESK and placebo groups, respectively. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 1 (4 hours postdose) was significantly greater for ESK treatment compared with placebo (Least‐square [LS] mean difference:‐5.3 [SE: 2.10]; 2‐sided p =0.015). Secondary endpoint findings showed significantly greater change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 2 for ESK treatment vs placebo (LS mean difference:‐7.2 [SE: 2.85]; 2‐sided p =0.015). Patients in the ESK group showed significantly greater improvement vs placebo in the MADRS suicide item at day 1 (4 hours postdose; 2‐sided p =0.002). The ESK treatment showed evidence of potential therapeutic effect vs placebo for the MADRS suicide item at day 2 (2‐sided p =0.129) and CGJ‐SR change from baseline at 4 hours (2‐sided p =0.112) and day 2 (2‐sided p =0.150). A greater proportion of patients in ESK group achieved resolution of suicide risk (CGJ‐SR score of 0 or 1) vs placebo at 4 hours (21.2% [7/33] vs 9.7% [3/31]) and day 2 (40% [14/35] vs 6.5% [2/31]). The response rate at day 2 was higher in ESK group (54.3%; 9/35) vs placebo group (29%; 9/31). Similarly, the remission rate at day 2 was higher for patients treated with ESK (34.3%; 12/35) vs placebo (16.1%; 5/31). During the DB phase, the most common (=20%) TEAEs reported in the ESK group were nausea (37.1%), dizziness (34.3%), dysgeusia, headache and dissociation (31.4% each) and vomiting (20%); 4 patients experienced serious TEAEs during the DB phase (suicide ideation: 2, agitation: 1, depressive symptoms: 1). No death occurred in either group. In the ESK group, the dissociative/perceptual changes measured by CADSS had an onset shortly after the start of intranasal dosing and generally resolved by 2 hours post dose. Conclusions: In patients with MDD who were assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, intranasal ESK 84 mg demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful effects in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo at 4 hours (day 1) and ∼24 hours (day 2) after initial dose. A significant improvement in suicidality (as measured by MADRS suicide item and the CGJ‐SR from SIBAT) was also observed at these time points. Moreover, intranasal ESK treatment exhibited rapid onset of response and greater likelihood of remission in this vulnerable population. Treatment with intranasal ESK 84 mg was generally tolerated.","***TASK***

INPUT: Efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide: a proof-ofconcept study.^\nBackground: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have an increased risk of suicide that is 20 times greater than that of general population. The standard of care (SoC) for patients with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide includes hospitalization and treatment with conventional antidepressants for underlying depression. However, hospitalizations are temporary and do not eliminate the risk of suicide, and conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapies show a delayed onset of action that limits their utility in treating vulnerable patients. Recent clinical studies of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and one of its active isomers, esketamine (ESK), have suggested rapid onset of antidepressant action. In addition, preliminary studies of intravenous ketamine demonstrated rapid reduction of suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with MDD. Intranasal ESK is currently in development for the rapid reduction in symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: The PeRSEVERe trial was a randomized, doubleblind (DB), placebo‐controlled, multicenter, phase 2, proofof‐concept study.

METHODS: Individuals with comorbid DSM-5-defined PTSD and DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (N = 15) received 6 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg) on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule over a 12-day period from May 2015 to June 2016. Data from outcome measures were collected before and 24 hours after each infusion and weekly for 8 weeks following the final infusion. RESULTS: Continuous measures of symptom change were significant for both disorders and were associated with large effect sizes (mean decrease in PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score = 33.3 points [95% CI, 23.0-43.5 points], P < .0005, sample size-adjusted Cohen d [d'] = 2.17; mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score = 26.6 points [95% CI, 23.0-30.2 points], P < .0005, d' = 4.64). The remission rate for PTSD was 80.0%, and the response rate for TRD was 93.3%. Participants in remission from PTSD after the infusion series (n = 12) had a median time to relapse of 41 days. Similarly, participants whose depression symptoms responded to the infusion series (n = 14) had a median time to relapse of 20 days. Repeated ketamine infusions were associated with transient increases in dissociative symptoms. No participant reported worsening of PTSD symptoms over the study duration. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first open-label study of repeated ketamine infusions in a comorbid population, found rapid and sustained improvement in PTSD and depression symptoms.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is thought to be mediated by NMDA receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to receive a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The P300 ERP was recorded at baseline and 40 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02) and decreased the latency of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have a direct effect on the P300 ERP, which may be mediated by NMDA receptors. This study provides further evidence that ketamine may have a direct effect on the brain.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,2
2373,"Early effects predict trajectories of response to esketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: The efficacy of esketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has been confirmed. However, its administration is expensive and restrictive, with limited knowledge on how long the treatment should be continued. Predicting the treatment outcome would benefit patients and alleviate the global treatment cost. We aimed to define distinct trajectories of treatment response and assess their predictability. Methods: In this longitudinal study, two independent samples of patients with unipolar or bipolar TRD were treated with esketamine in real-world settings. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before each esketamine administration. Latent class analyses were used to define trajectories of response. Results: In the original sample (N = 50), we identified two classes whose trajectories depicted response and non-response, respectively. The model was validated in the confirmatory sample (N = 55). Class membership was influenced by a few baseline characteristics such as concomitant benzodiazepine medication, number of depressive episodes or polarity. On the other hand, after only two esketamine administrations, the MADRS score predicted the 90-day trajectory of response with an accuracy of 80 %. Limitations: This observational study is not placebo-controlled. Therefore, its results and their generalizability need to be confirmed in experimental settings. Conclusions: After the first administrations of esketamine, the MADRS score has a good capacity to predict the most plausible trajectory of response. While thresholds and their predictive values need to be confirmed, this finding suggests that clinicians could base on MADRS scores their decision to discontinue treatment because of poor remaining chances of treatment response.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anaesthetic for over 40 years. It is also used as a treatment for depression and has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects. The mechanism of action of ketamine in depression is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its effects on the glutamatergic system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were recruited to the study. EEG was recorded before and after the administration of a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). The EEG was analysed using a combination of time-frequency analysis and independent component analysis. Results: Ketamine administration was associated with a significant increase in the power of the EEG in the theta and alpha frequency bands. There was also a significant increase in the power of the EEG in the beta frequency band in the right frontal region. There was no significant change in the power of the EEG in the gamma frequency band. Conclusions: Ketamine administration was associated with a significant increase in the power of the EEG in the theta and alpha frequency bands. This suggests that ketamine may have a direct effect on the EEG. The increase in the power of the EEG in the beta frequency band in the right frontal region suggests that ketamine may have a direct effect on the frontal cortex. The lack of a significant change in the power of the EEG in the gamma frequency band suggests that ketamine may not have a direct effect on the gamma frequency band.

The increase in the power of the EEG in the beta frequency band in the right frontal region suggests that ketamine may have a direct effect on the frontal cortex. The lack of a significant change in the power of the EEG in the gamma frequency band suggests that ketamine may not have a direct effect on the gamma frequency band.

INPUT: The effect of ketamine on the electroencephalogram in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anaesthetic for over 40 years. It is also used as a treatment for depression and has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects. The mechanism of action of ketamine in depression is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its effects on the glutamatergic system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were recruited to the study. EEG was recorded before and after the administration of a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0",Med-LLaMA3-8B,4
7943,"A randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled study of efficacy, safety, and durability of repeated vs single subanesthetic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nThe strategy of repeated ketamine in open-label and saline-control studies of treatment-resistant depression suggested greater antidepressant response beyond a single ketamine. However, consensus guideline stated the lack of evidence to support frequent ketamine administration. We compared the efficacy and safety of single vs. six repeated ketamine using midazolam as active placebo. Subjects received either six ketamine or five midazolam followed by a single ketamine during 12 days followed by up to 6-month post-treatment period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h after the last infusion. Fifty-four subjects completed all six infusions. For the primary outcome measure, there was no significant difference in change of MADRS scores between six ketamine group and single ketamine group at 24 h post-last infusion. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy compared to midazolam after five infusions before receiving single ketamine infusion. Remission and response favored the six ketamine after infusion 4 and 5, respectively, compared to midazolam before receiving single ketamine infusion. For those who responded, the median time-to-relapse was nominally but not statistically different (2 and 6 weeks for the single and six ketamine group, respectively). Repeated infusions were relatively well-tolerated. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy to midazolam after five infusions but fell short of significance when compared to add-on single ketamine to midazolam at the end of 2 weeks. Increasing knowledge on the mechanism of ketamine should drive future studies on the optimal balance of dosing ketamine for maximum antidepressant efficacy with minimum exposure.","***TASK***

4236,"The efficacy of oral ketamine in severely depressed patients at high risk of suicide.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is most easily and inexpensively administered by the oral route and in racemic form. Oral racemic ketamine may be an important approach to the emergency management of suicide risk in clinical settings, especially in third world countries, that have a limited range of available healthcare resources. METHODS: In a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label investigation, we studied 30 severely depressed inpatients who consented to participate in a pilot hospital service offering ketamine for management of high suicide risk. Patients sipped a solution of racemic ketamine (150 mg) across 10-15 min in 3 alternate day sessions.

7436,"Impact of a Naturalistic Psychedelic Experience on Smoking: A Retrospective Survey.^\nTobacco use disorder is a major public health concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a psychedelic experience in a natural context on tobacco use. A retrospective online survey was conducted on 173 individuals who reported having had a psychedelic experience while being smokers. Demographic information was collected, and characteristics of the psychedelic experience, tobacco addiction and psychological flexibility were assessed. Mean number of cigarettes smoked per day, and proportion of individuals with high tobacco dependency significantly decreased between the three time points (p <.001). Participants who reduced or quit smoking had more intense mystical experiences during the psychedelic session (p =.01) and lower psychological flexibility before the psychedelic experience (p =.018). The increase in psychological flexibility post psychedelic session, and the personal motives for the psychedelic experience were significant positive predictors of smoking reduction or cessation (p <.001).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin on amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli.^\nThe serotonergic system is implicated in the regulation of emotional processing. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin has been shown to induce acute changes in emotional processing in humans. The present study investigated the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design, 15 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) and placebo in a counterbalanced order. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure amygdala reactivity to emotional faces. Psilocybin increased amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, but not to happy faces. The effect of psilocybin on amygdala reactivity to fearful faces was positively correlated with the subjective experience of anxiety. These findings suggest that psilocybin increases amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli, and that this effect is related to the subjective experience of anxiety.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg MDMA on the subjective experience of music.^\nRATIONALE: ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a psychoactive drug that is widely used recreationally. It is also being investigated as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The subjective effects of MDMA are well documented, but little is known about its effects on music. METHOD: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a 10-minute music listening task during which they listened to a 10-minute excerpt of a song of their choice. The music listening task was completed 90 minutes after drug administration. Participants rated the subjective effects of the music on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and completed a 10-item questionnaire about their experience of the music. RESULTS: MDMA increased ratings of the subjective effects of music on a number of dimensions, including the intensity of the music, the emotional impact of the music, and the extent to which the music was enjoyable. MDMA also increased ratings of the subjective effects of the music on a number of dimensions that are not typically associated with music, including the extent to which the music was ""psychedelic"" and the extent to which the music was ""mind-altering"". CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MDMA increases the subjective effects of music, and that the subjective effects of music are not limited to those that are typically associated with music. These findings may have implications for the use of MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, as well as for the use of music in the treatment of PTSD.

Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies.","***TASK***

1950,"Sustained effects of ecstasy on the human brain: A prospective neuroimaging study in novel users.^\nPrevious studies have suggested toxic effects of recreational ecstasy use on the serotonin system of the brain. However, it cannot be excluded that observed differences between users and non-users are the cause rather than the consequence of ecstasy use. As part of the Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study, we prospectively assessed sustained effects of ecstasy use on the brain in novel ecstasy users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. At baseline, 188 ecstasy-naive volunteers with high probability of first ecstasy use were examined. After a mean period of 17 months follow-up, neuroimaging was repeated in 59 incident ecstasy users and 56 matched persistent ecstasy-naives and their outcomes were compared. Neuroimaging included [123I]β- carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (CIT) SPECT to measure serotonin transporter densities as indicators of serotonergic function; 1H-MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure brain metabolites as indicators of neuronal damage; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusional motion of water molecules in the brain as indicators of axonal integrity; and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) to measure regional relative cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) which indicates brain perfusion. With this approach, both structural (1H-MRS and DTI) and functional ([123I]β-CIT SPECT and PWI) aspects of neurotoxicity were combined. Compared to persistent ecstasy-naives, novel low-dose ecstasy users (mean 6.0, median 2.0 tablets) showed decreased rrCBV in the globus pallidus and putamen; decreased FA in thalamus and frontoparietal white matter; increased FA in globus pallidus; and increased apparent diffusion coefficient in the thalamus. No changes in serotonin transporter densities and brain metabolites were observed. These findings suggest sustained effects of ecstasy on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation and possibly axonal damage due to low dosages of ecstasy.

INPUT: Sustained effects of ecstasy on the human brain: A prospective neuroimaging study in novel users.^\nPrevious studies have suggested toxic effects of recreational ecstasy use on the serotonin system of the brain. However, it cannot be excluded that observed differences between users and non-users are the cause rather than the consequence of ecstasy use. As part of the Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study, we prospectively assessed sustained effects of ecstasy use on the brain in novel ecstasy users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. At baseline, 188 ecstasy-naive volunteers with high probability of first ecstasy use were examined. After a mean period of 17 months follow-up, neuroimaging was repeated in 59 incident ecstasy users and 56 matched persistent ecstasy-naives and their outcomes were compared. Neuroimaging included [123I]β- carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (CIT) SPECT to measure serotonin transporter densities as indicators of serotonergic function; 1H-MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure brain metabolites as indicators of neuronal damage; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the diffusional motion of water molecules in the brain as indicators of axonal integrity; and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) to measure regional relative cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) which indicates brain perfusion. With this approach, both structural (1H-MRS and DTI) and functional ([123I]β-CIT SPECT and PWI) aspects of neurotoxicity were combined. Compared to persistent ecstasy-naives, novel low-dose ecstasy users (mean 6.0, median 2.0 tablets) showed decreased rrCBV in the globus pallidus and putamen; decreased FA in thalamus and frontoparietal white matter; increased FA in globus pallidus; and increased apparent diffusion coefficient in the thalamus. No changes in serotonin transporter densities and brain metabolites were observed. These findings suggest sustained effects of ecstasy on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation and possibly axonal damage due to low dosages of ecstasy. Although we do not know yet whether these effects are reversible or not, we cannot exclude that ecstasy even in low doses is neurotoxic to the brain. © The Author (2008).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans.^\nPsilocybin is a classic psychedelic that has been used in psychotherapy for over 50 years. The psychedelic effects of psilocybin are mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor, and the effects of psilocybin are potentiated by the 5-HT2A agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). The present study examined the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before receiving psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). The effects of psilocybin were assessed using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire, the Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Autonomic effects were assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance. The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective effects of psilocybin, as measured by the 5D-ASC, CEQ, and POMS. 5-MeO-DMT also significantly increased the autonomic effects of psilocybin, as measured by HRV and skin conductance. These results suggest that 5-MeO-DMT potentiates the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans. The results also suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may be a useful adjunct to psilocybin therapy. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
