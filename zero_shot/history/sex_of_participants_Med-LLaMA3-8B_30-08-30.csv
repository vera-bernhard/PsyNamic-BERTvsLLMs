1385,"A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module in Australian secondary schools: study protocol.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of ecstasy is a public health problem and is associated with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

5346,"Real-world experience of esketamine use to manage treatment-resistant depression: A multicentric study on safety and effectiveness (REAL-ESK study).^\nBACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant Depression (TRD) represents a widespread disorder with significant direct and indirect healthcare costs. esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has been recently approved for TRD, but real-world studies are needed to prove its efficacy in naturalistic settings. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esketamine nasal spray in a clinical sample of patients with TRD from several Italian mental health services. METHODS: REAL-ESK study is an observational, retrospective and multicentric study comprising a total of 116 TRD patients treated with esketamine nasal spray. Anamnestic data and psychometric assessment (MADRS, HAMD-21, HAM-A) were collected from medical records at baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three month (T2) follow-ups. RESULTS: A significant reduction of depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0. A dramatic increase in clinical response (64.2 %) and remission rates (40.6 %) was detected at T2 compared to T1. No unexpected safety concerns were observed, side effects rates were comparable to those reported in RCTs. No differences in efficacy have been found among patients with and without psychiatric comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: The open design of the study and the absence of a placebo or active comparator group are limitations. The study lacks an inter-rater reliability evaluation of the assessments among the different centres. Side effects evaluation did not involve any specific scale.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is sensitive to the effects of antidepressant medications. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02) and decreased the latency of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have antidepressant effects by modulating the P300 ERP.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

Fifteen MDMA users, who did not have other drug dependencies or alcohol abuse, and had not used other drugs for prolonged periods, and 15 control individuals were included in a study to assess the biological and psychological changes after chronic use of MDMA. Prolactin and cortisol responses to D-fenfluramine challenge, clinical psychobehavioural changes, personality characteristics, including mood, aggressiveness and temperamental aspects, were evaluated 3 weeks after MDMA discontinuation. MDMA users had significantly reduced prolactin and cortisol responses in comparison with control individuals (p < 0.001 and p < 0.005, respectively). Dysphoria and mood changes were exhibited in seven individuals, tiredness in five and sensation-seeking behaviour in twelve at the clinical evaluation. Significantly higher scores were found in MDMA individuals than in control individuals for Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory subscale for Depression, for Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory direct and guilt subscales, for Hamilton Depression Bating Scale and for novelty-seeking Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire subscale. Prolactin responses to D-fenfluramine stimulation area under the curve among MDMA users were negatively correlated with direct aggressiveness scores for Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory; a negative correlation between prolactin responses and novelty-seeking scores was also evidenced among MDMA users. These data suggest an association between serotonin system impairment and MDMA use in humans; in interpretation of these results, the possibility that serotonin deficit in MDMA individuals was partially related to a premorbid condition, in relationship with novelty-seeking behaviour and mood disorders, can not be excluded.","***TASK***

The results were compared with those obtained in 10 subjects who received placebo. The administration of 5-HTP was followed by a significant increase in the total amount of sleep, in the amount of slow wave sleep and in the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The latency to the first REM period was significantly reduced. The results suggest that 5-HTP is able to induce a sleep pattern similar to that observed in the first part of the night.

RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the review. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA and were small in size. The interventions were diverse and included individual counselling, group counselling, peer education, and community education. The majority of studies reported positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that interventions to improve the sexual health of women living with HIV infection are effective. However, the majority of studies were small and of poor methodological quality.

6250,"Acute Effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) With and Without a Booster Dose.^\nMDMA is a psychoactive substance that primarily enhances serotonergic neurotransmission by releasing 5‐HT through the SERT. It also releases dopamine and norepinephrine, although less potently, through the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter, respectively. In addition to its use as a recreational drug, MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy has been investigated in several phase 2 trials and one phase 3 trial for PTSD. Further indications for MDMA‐assisted therapy being planned or ongoing are eating disorders, social anxiety, and alcohol use disorder. The present study focuses on dosing aspects of MDMA used in clinical studies and recreational settings, specifically the benefits of a second administration (booster dose) given several hours after the initial dose. Most published studies of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy used a booster dose. A typical dosing regimen would be 80‐120 mg of MDMA initially followed by half the initial dose after 1.5‐2.5 hours. Although previous studies have found that a booster dose could prolong the acute effects of MDMA, others have shown an acute tolerance reflected in the finding that acute subjective effects return to baseline within 4‐5 hours, while plasma concentrations are still close to peak levels. These findings have led to controversy regarding how effective a booster dose would be in prolonging acute effects, as it has never been directly compared to placebo. Additionally, the higher total dose could lead to an increase in side effects. Therefore, the present phase 1 study intends to compare the acute subjective, physiological, and endocrine effects of MDMA (120 mg + 60 mg after 2 hours), MDMA (120 mg + placebo after 2 hours), and (placebo + placebo after 2 hours) using a double‐blind, random‐order, crossover design in healthy subjects.","***TASK***

Therefore, the present phase 1 study intends to compare the acute subjective, physiological, and endocrine effects of MDMA (120 mg + 60 mg after 2 hours), MDMA (120 mg + placebo after 2 hours), and (placebo + placebo after 2 hours) using a double‐blind, random‐order, crossover design in healthy subjects.

6366,"Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. METHODS: Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response. RESULTS: Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. LIMITATIONS: Possible inadequate blinding; combined MDD/BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine's antidepressant efficacy; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: From a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and instructed to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. RESULTS: Ketamine increased the intensity of the emotional response to the faces, as measured by the subjective ratings. This was associated with increased activity in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine may be mediated by increased activity in the amygdala and ACC.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0
4728,"Patients' recovery and non-recovery narratives after intravenous ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) ketamine is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A large data base is confirmatory and steadily expanding. Qualitative studies can inform best practices and suggest new research directions. As part of a clinical trial designed to identify biomarkers of ketamine response, a qualitative study was conducted to characterize experiences with: receiving infusions; recovering or not recovering from depression; and beliefs about why ketamine worked or did not work. METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression received three IV ketamine infusions in a two-week period and were characterized as remitters or non-remitters via symptom reduction 24 h after the third infusion. Qualitative interviews of a subset of participants were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive methods. Themes were derived and compared across a broader construct of recovery status. RESULTS: Of the 21 participants, nine (43 %) were characterized as having experienced remission and 12 (57 %) non-remission. Of the 12 non-remitters, five were characterized as having experienced partial recovery based on their subjective experiences, reporting substantial benefit from ketamine infusions despite non-remission status based on scale measurements. Attributions for ketamine's effects included biological and experiential mechanisms. Among non-remitters there was risk of disappointment when adding another failed treatment. LIMITATIONS: A more diverse sample may have yielded different themes. Different patients had different amounts of time elapsed between ketamine infusions and qualitative interview. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods may enhance researchers' characterization of IV ketamine's impact on treatment-resistant depression. While requiring confirmation, patients may benefit from a preparatory milieu that prepares them for multiple recovery pathways; decouples the psychedelic experience from clinical outcomes; and addresses potential risks of another failed treatment.","***TASK***

Previous research has led to the designation of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a Breakthrough Therapy for treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when administered as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Objectives: Here we report the findings of the first randomized, double‐blind, Phase 3 trial assessing the efficacy and safety of 3 sessions with a flexible dose of MDMA or placebo administered under direct observation to participants with severe PTSD (n = 100) as an adjunct to inner‐directed psychotherapy. Methods: Change in PTSD symptoms (CAPS‐5) and functional impairment (SDS) were assessed by a central, blinded Independent Rater Pool at baseline and following each treatment session. Adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, suicidal ideation and behavior were tracked throughout the study. Vital signs were measured during experimental sessions. The primary endpoint was 18 weeks post‐randomization. Results: Change in CAPS‐5 and SDS, placebo‐subtracted Cohen's d effect size, and a responder analysis will be presented. There were three serious AEs of suicidal ideation or behavior reported.MDMA was well tolerated, with some treatment emergent AEs occurring at greater frequency for the MDMA group during and after experimental sessions.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the subjective experience of pain: a controlled study.^\nBackground: The subjective experience of pain is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. The present study examined the effect of a single dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on the subjective experience of pain. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either 125 mg of MDMA or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Pain was induced by a cold pressor test (CPT) and a heat pain test (HPT). The subjective experience of pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a verbal rating scale (VRS). Results: The CPT and HPT were equally effective in inducing pain. MDMA significantly reduced the subjective experience of pain during the CPT and HPT. The effect of MDMA on the subjective experience of pain was not related to the subjective experience of drug effects. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that a single dose of MDMA reduces the subjective experience of pain. The effect of MDMA on the subjective experience of pain is not related to the subjective experience of drug effects. The results of the present study suggest that MDMA may be a useful tool in the treatment of chronic pain.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0
9446,"Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.","***TASK***

The effect of sex on the pharmacokinetics of LEV was evaluated in 12 healthy male and 12 healthy female subjects. Subjects received a single 500-mg oral dose of LEV. Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period and plasma concentrations of LEV were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. The mean (+/- SD) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were 6.5 +/- 1.9 micrograms/mL and 24.2 +/- 6.7 micrograms x h/mL, respectively, in males and 6.3 +/- 1.8 micrograms/mL and 23.1 +/- 6.5 micrograms x h/mL, respectively, in females. The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 0.26 +/- 0.08 L/h/kg in males and 0.27 +/- 0.08 L/h/kg in females. The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 0.58 +/- 0.16 L/kg in males and 0.59 +/- 0.16 L/kg in females. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was 6.9 +/- 1.9 hours in males and 7.1 +/- 1.8 hours in females. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the geometric means of the pharmacokinetic parameters were within the 80% to 125% range for all parameters.

Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements.

4292,"Psychedelic Communitas: Intersubjective Experience During Psychedelic Group Sessions Predicts Enduring Changes in Psychological Wellbeing and Social Connectedness.^\nBackground: Recent years have seen a resurgence of research on the potential of psychedelic substances to treat addictive and mood disorders. Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2 weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4 weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes. Using correlational and multiple regression (path) analyses, predictive relationships between psychosocial 'set and setting' variables, communitas, and long-term outcomes were explored. Results: The adapted Communitas Scale demonstrated substantial internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and construct validity in comparison with validated measures of intra-subjective (visual, mystical, challenging experiences questionnaires) and inter-subjective (perceived emotional synchrony, identity fusion) experiences. Furthermore, communitas during ceremony was significantly correlated with increases in psychological wellbeing (r = 0.22), social connectedness (r = 0.25), and other salient mental health outcomes. Path analyses revealed that the effect of ceremony-communitas on long-term outcomes was fully mediated by communitas experienced in reference to the retreat overall, and that the extent of personal sharing or 'self-disclosure' contributed to this process. A positive relationship between participants and facilitators, and the perceived impact of emotional support, facilitated the emergence of communitas. Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of intersubjective experience, rapport, and emotional support for long-term outcomes of psychedelic use, this first quantitative examination of psychosocial factors in guided psychedelic settings is a significant step toward evidence-based benefit-maximization guidelines for collective psychedelic use.","***TASK***

INPUT: Psychedelic Communitas: Intersubjective Experience During Psychedelic Group Sessions Predicts Enduring Changes in Psychological Wellbeing and Social Connectedness.^\nBackground: Recent years have seen a resurgence of research on the potential of psychedelic substances to treat addictive and mood disorders. Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2 weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4 weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes.

The subjective experience of time is a fundamental aspect of human consciousness, and psychedelic drugs have been shown to alter the perception of time. However, the effect of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time. METHODS: A total of 20 healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. Participants were administered a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (25 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. The subjective experience of time was assessed using the Time Experience Questionnaire (TEQ) before and after drug administration. RESULTS: The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective experience of time, as measured by the TEQ. Specifically, participants reported a greater sense of timelessness, a decreased sense of time passing, and a decreased sense of time pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT alters the subjective experience of time, and may have implications for the understanding of the role of psychedelics in the treatment of time-related disorders such as depression and anxiety.

1886,"Modulation of Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor by a Single Dose of Ayahuasca: Observation From a Randomized Controlled Trial.^\nSerotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant.

INPUT: Modulation of Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor by a Single Dose of Ayahuasca: Observation From a Randomized Controlled Trial.^\nSerotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ayahuasca on plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in healthy volunteers: a randomized clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that plays a key role in the development and maintenance of the central nervous system. BDNF is also involved in the pathophysiology of depression and has been proposed as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a single dose of ayahuasca on plasma levels of BDNF in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted with 16 healthy volunteers. The volunteers received a single dose of ayahuasca (0.5 mg/kg of body weight of DMT) or placebo (water) in two different sessions, with a 1-week interval between them. Blood samples were collected before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after the administration of ayahuasca or placebo. Plasma levels of BDNF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The plasma levels of BDNF were significantly higher in the ayahuasca session than in the placebo session at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after the administration of ayahuasca. CONCLUSION: A single dose of ayahuasca increases plasma levels of BDNF in healthy volunteers. This finding may contribute to the understanding of the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02914769).

INPUT: A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the sexual health of women living with HIV.^\nBackground: Women living with HIV (WLWH) are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV transmission to their partners. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH.Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between 1990 and 2015. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) that evaluated interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH. We excluded studies that focused on HIV prevention or treatment, or that did not include WLWH. We extracted data on study design, population, intervention, and outcomes. We assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for CBAs. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool results.Results: We identified 10 RCTs and 2 CBAs. The interventions included behavioral interventions (n = 6), biomedical interventions (n = 3), and a combination of behavioral and biomedical interventions (n = 3). The behavioral interventions included counseling, peer education, and group education. The biomedical interventions included pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART). The combined interventions included PrEP and counseling. The outcomes included STI incidence, HIV incidence, and condom use. The quality of the studies was generally low. The pooled results showed that behavioral interventions were associated with a reduction in STI incidence (risk ratio [RR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.95) and HIV incidence (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.93). The pooled results for the biomedical interventions showed that PrEP was associated with a reduction in STI incidence (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83) and HIV incidence (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83). The pooled results for the combined interventions showed that PrEP and counseling were associated with a reduction in STI incidence (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83) and HIV incidence (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.83).Conclusions: Behavioral interventions and PrEP were associated with a reduction in STI and HIV incidence among WLWH. The combined interventions of PrEP and counseling were also associated with a reduction in STI and HIV incidence. However, the quality of the studies was generally low, and the results should be interpreted with caution.

5628,"An encounter with the self: A thematic and content analysis of the DMT experience from a naturalistic field study.^\nINTRODUCTION: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous serotonergic psychedelic capable of producing radical shifts in an experience that have significant implications for consciousness and its neural correlates, especially given the ""disconnected consciousness"" suggested by the ""breakthrough"" DMT state. Its increasing usage and clinical trial indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the experience's qualitative content, over and above the phenomenological structure. This is particularly in light of the intensely pervasive effects of DMT occasions in all dimensions of the self, which are often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative. METHODS: This is the second report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use exploring its qualitative analysis. Screened, healthy, anonymized, and experienced DMT users were observed during their non-clinical use of the drug at home (40-75-mg inhaled). In-depth semi-structured interviews, inspired by the micro-phenomenological technique, were employed immediately after their experience. This study reports on the thematic and content analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited, the ""self""; where analyses of the ""other"" were previously reported. A total of 36 post-DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian (83%) men (eight women) of a mean of 37 years were predominantly inductively coded. RESULTS: Invariably, profound and highly intense experiences occurred. The first overarching category comprised the onset of effects, encompassing super-ordinate themes including sensory, emotion and body, and space-time shifts; the second category comprised bodily effects, encompassing themes including pleasurable, neutral/both, and uncomfortable; the third category comprised the sensorial effects, encompassing open-eye, visual, and cross-modal and other; the fourth comprised the psychological effects, encompassing memory and language, awareness and sense of self, and time distortions; and the fifth comprised the emotional effects, encompassing positive, neither/both, and challenging experiences. Many further subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience. DISCUSSION: The present study provides a systematic and nuanced analysis of the content of the breakthrough DMT state pertaining to one's personal and self-referential experiences of the body, senses, psychology, and emotions. The resonances both with previous DMT studies and other types of extraordinary experiences, such as the alien abduction, shamanic and near-death experiences, are also elaborated upon.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the personality and mental state of healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound that has been used in traditional shamanic rituals for centuries. It is a potent agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor and has been shown to produce profound changes in mood and perception. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the personality and mental state of healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. They were administered a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) and were assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) before and after the administration of the drug. RESULTS: The TCI scores showed a significant increase in the Harm Avoidance (HA) and Self-Directedness (SD) scales after the administration of 5-MeO-DMT. The SCL-90-R scores showed a significant decrease in the Global Severity Index (GSI) and the Positive Symptom Total (PST) after the administration of 5-MeO-DMT. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT can produce significant changes in the personality and mental state of healthy volunteers. The increase in HA and SD scores suggests that 5-MeO-DMT can produce a more cautious and self-directed personality. The decrease in GSI and PST scores suggests that 5-MeO-DMT can produce a more positive mental state. These findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

4640,"Ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking while decreasing conventional convergent thinking.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the ""pattern/line meanings test"" (PLMT) and the ""picture concept test"" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin on regional cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers: an [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography study^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a 5-HT2A receptor agonist that has been shown to produce profound changes in mood and perception in healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers were studied using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) before and after a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). Results: Psilocybin produced a significant increase in rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and lateral parietal cortex. There was a significant decrease in rCBF in the left inferior temporal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that psilocybin produces a pattern of rCBF changes that is consistent with the effects of psilocybin on mood and perception. The results also suggest that the effects of psilocybin on rCBF are similar to those of other 5-HT2A receptor agonists, such as LSD and mescaline.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers were studied using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) before and after a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). Results: Psilocybin produced a significant increase in rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and lateral parietal cortex. There was a significant decrease in rCBF in the left inferior temporal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus.

7113,"Pediatric premedication: a double-blind randomized trial of dexmedetomidine or ketamine alone versus a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients. When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication, children tend to awaken when separated from their parents, and body movements occur during invasive procedures. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients, while producing minimal adverse events. METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3 mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6 mg/kg (group K) 30 min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P = 0.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P = 0.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P = 0.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and oral ketamine 3 mg/kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation, allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia.

Available antidepressants often fail to provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI) in acutely suicidal patients with MDD and there are currently no approved treatments for this population. In 2016, esketamine (ESK) was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for MDD patients at imminent risk for suicide based on data suggesting rapid reduction in depressive symptoms, including SI observed at 4 hours after an initial dose of ESK nasal spray in a phase 2 study [2]. The efficacy and safety of ESK nasal spray is being further evaluated in ASPIRE‐2, one of two phase 3 studies in the first global registration program in an understudied population of MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: ASPIRE‐2 (NCT03097133) is an ongoing double‐blind (DB), randomised, placebo‐controlled study being conducted in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the United States. Adult patients (18 to 64 years) with MDD (DSM‐5 criteria, confirmed by Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), with active SI and intent and in need of psychiatric hospitalisation were eligible. All patients received optimized standard‐of‐care (SoC hospitalisation and initiation/optimisation of antidepressant treatment). Patients were randomised (1:1) to ESK (84 mg) or placebo nasal spray twice‐weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to SoC. Change from baseline (day 1, predose) to 24 hours after first dose in Montgomery‐Ǻsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (primary endpoint) and Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Suicidality – Revised (CGI‐SS‐R) from the Suicide Ideation and Behaviour Assessment Tool (SIBAT) were assessed for efficacy. Treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), potential suicidal events from the SIBAT and dissociative effects (Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale [CADSS]) were monitored for safety. Results: In total, 230 patients have been randomised to ESK+SoC or placebo+SoC; 184 (80%) patients completed the DB treatment (Table 1). Conclusions: MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent represent a vulnerable group in need of rapid treatment of their symptoms.

INPUT: P.608 Efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray in patients with treatment-resistant depression: A phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.^\nIntroduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide.1,2 Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a common and debilitating condition, affecting approximately 30% of patients with MDD.3,4 The pathophysiology of TRD is complex and not well understood.5,6 The current standard of care for TRD is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is associated with significant adverse effects and is not widely available.7,8 Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with TRD.9,10 However, ketamine is associated with dissociative and psychotomimetic effects, which limit its use.11,12 Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has been shown to have similar antidepressant effects as ketamine, but with a lower incidence of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects.13,14 The efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray in patients with TRD is being evaluated in a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (NCT02417064). Methods: Patients with MDD (DSM-5 criteria, confirmed by MINI) who had failed to respond to at least two antidepressant treatments (including at least one adequate trial of an antidepressant at an appropriate dose for at least 6 weeks) were eligible for the study. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive esketamine nasal spray (84 mg) or placebo nasal spray twice weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to an oral antidepressant. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4; change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose in MADRS total score at weeks 2, 3, and 4 in patients with a baseline MADRS total score ≥ 30 and a baseline CGI-S score ≥ 4",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0
319,"Psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder: a clinical perspective.^\nBackground: Hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin have reemerged as promising adjunctive treatments for alcohol use disorder. A recent open‐label study of psilocybin with 12 weeks of psychosocial treatment for alcohol use disorder showed a significant acute reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days, post‐psilocybin administration for 36 weeks (Bogenschutz, 2015). Furthermore, the study showed that psilocybin‐assisted treatment was safe, feasible, and tolerable. The methods and outcomes of that study were foundational in the design of this current investigation which is an ongoing double‐blind active controlled clinical trial of psilocybin‐assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (target enrollment, n = 180). Methods: Patients with alcohol use disorder were assigned to either receive orally administered psilocybin or diphenhydramine in two or three sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement and Taking Action (META) therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Total treatment course was 42 weeks. Three patients who completed treatment in the trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Treatment assignment has not been un‐blinded. Results: All three patients had a reduction in heavy drinking behavior. Two of the three patients were abstinent by the end of the trial. One of the three patients declined medication after his first session. Experiences were intense and memorable in ways that were unique to each patient. Conclusions: Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of psilocybin on affective style and creative thinking.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic drug that has been shown to produce profound changes in mood and cognition. The present study investigated the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on affective style and creative thinking. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Affective style was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Creative thinking was assessed using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). Results: Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive affect and a significant decrease in negative affect on the PANAS. On the POMS, psilocybin produced a significant decrease in tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. Psilocybin also produced a significant increase in the TTCT's fluency, flexibility, and originality scores. Conclusions: These results suggest that psilocybin produces a robust increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect, and that these changes are associated with increased creative thinking. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that psilocybin produces a state of enhanced emotional processing and may have implications for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.

INPUT: Psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder: a clinical perspective.^\nBackground: Hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin have reemerged as promising adjunctive treatments for alcohol use disorder. A recent open‐label study of psilocybin with 12 weeks of psychosocial treatment for alcohol use disorder showed a significant acute reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days, post‐psilocybin administration for 36 weeks (Bogenschutz, 2015). Furthermore, the study showed that psilocybin‐assisted treatment was safe, feasible, and tolerable. The methods and outcomes of that study were foundational in the design of this current investigation which is an ongoing double‐blind active controlled clinical trial of psilocybin‐assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (target enrollment, n = 180). Methods: Patients with alcohol use disorder were assigned to either receive orally administered psilocybin or diphenhydramine in two or three sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement and Taking Action (META) therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Total treatment course was 42 weeks. Three patients who completed treatment in the trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Treatment assignment has not been un‐blinded. Results: All three patients had a reduction in heavy drinking behavior. Two of the three patients were abstinent by the end of the trial. One of the three patients declined medication after his first session. Experiences were intense and memorable in ways that were unique to each patient. Conclusions: Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. Summary: This study examined psilocybin as a potential adjunctive therapy for patients with alcohol use disorder. Three patients from our ongoing double‐blind activecontrolled clinical trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. This study has important implications for the future developments of treatment for alcohol use disorder as it may provide another accessible means of therapy for an incredible complex disease process.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of psilocybin on affective style and creative thinking.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic drug that has been shown to produce profound changes in mood and cognition. The present study investigated the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on affective style and creative thinking. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Affective style was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Creative thinking was assessed using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). Results: Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive affect and a significant decrease in negative affect on the PANAS. On the POMS, psilocybin produced a significant decrease in tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment.

6698,"The effects of ketamine on typical and atypical depressive symptoms.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine's effects on different dimensions of depressive symptomatology, including typical/melancholic and atypical depression, remain largely unknown. This study examined the effects of a single intravenous dose of ketamine on general depressive symptoms (measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), typical/melancholic symptoms (measured using the MADRS5), and atypical symptoms (measured using the Scale for Atypical Symptoms (SAS)). METHODS: Data from 68 participants with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression were pooled from three separate, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies investigating ketamine's efficacy in depression. MDD participants were unmedicated; bipolar participants received therapeutic-dose lithium or valproate. Clinical symptoms were collected preinfusion and up to 14 days postinfusion. Effect sizes were calculated for days 1 and 3 postinfusion. The primary measures of interest for this exploratory analysis were total MADRS, MADRS5, and SAS scores. Individual symptoms were also analyzed in an exploratory manner. RESULTS: Scores improved significantly at Day 1 postinfusion (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.64; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.61; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.41) and continued to be significantly improved over placebo at Day 3 (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.49; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.43; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.39).

There are no pharmacogenetic studies on LSD. In vitro metabolic studies indicate that several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9) are involved in LSD metabolism, but in vivo data are scarce. The present study examined the influence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP genes on the pharmacokinetics and acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. We identified common genetic variants of CYPs (CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) in 81 healthy subjects who were pooled from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 studies. We found that genetically determined CYP2D6 functionality significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of LSD. Individuals with no functional CYP2D6 (i.e., poor metabolizers) had longer LSD half-lives and approximately 75% higher parent drug and main metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD area-under-the-curve blood plasma concentrations compared with carriers of functional CYP2D6. Non-functional CYP2D6 metabolizers also exhibited greater alterations of mind and longer subjective effect durations in response to LSD compared with functional CYP2D6 metabolizers. No effect on the pharmacokinetics or acute effects of LSD were observed with other CYPs.

4652,"Cortisol levels and MDMA-induced memory impairment.^\nBackground: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA. The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA‐induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (Metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Methods: Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and Metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. A dose of 750mg Metyrapone had previously been used in other studies and it was shown that it effectively suppresses the synthesis of cortisol within 2 hours post‐dose. Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. Results: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment withMetyrapone blocked the expected MDMA‐induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA‐induced memory deficit from happening. Conclusion: We therefore conclude that MDMA‐induced increases in cortisol concentrations are not responsible for impairing memory performance while intoxicated with MDMA.","***TASK***

INPUT: Cortisol levels and MDMA-induced memory impairment.^\nBackground: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA. The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA‐induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (Metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Methods: Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and Metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. A dose of 750mg Metyrapone had previously been used in other studies and it was shown that it effectively suppresses the synthesis of cortisol within 2 hours post‐dose. Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. Results: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment withMetyrapone blocked the expected MDMA‐induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA‐induced memory deficit from happening. Conclusion: We therefore conclude that MDMA‐induced increases in cortisol concentrations are not responsible for impairing memory performance while intoxicated with MDMA.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and 40 min after drug administration while performing an emotional face-matching task. Results: Ketamine significantly increased the number of correct responses on the emotional face-matching task. There was a significant interaction between drug and time on the neural correlates of emotional processing. Ketamine significantly increased activation in the left amygdala, left hippocampus, left insula, and left inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a single dose of ketamine may enhance the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. This may be one of the mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. Further studies are needed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with depression.

The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its effects on the glutamatergic system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy volunteers (five males and five females) were recruited for this study. The EEG was recorded before and after the administration of a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). The EEG was recorded using a 19-channel EEG system. The EEG was analyzed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the power spectrum was calculated. The results showed that the administration of a single dose of intravenous ketamine had no significant effect on the EEG in healthy volunteers. The results of this study suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine are not related to its effects on the EEG. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy volunteers (five males and five females) were recruited for this study. The EEG was recorded before and after the administration of a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). The EEG was recorded using a 19-channel EEG system. The EEG was analyzed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the power spectrum was calculated. The results showed that the administration of a single dose of intravenous ketamine",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2-400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.","***TASK***

3765,"Low doses of lsd acutely increase bdnf blood plasma levels in healthy volunteers: preliminary findings.^\nBackground: Preclinical research has demonstrated that psychedelic substances from different structural classes such as 2,5‐ dimethoxy‐4‐iodoamphetamine (DOI), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N‐dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and psilocybin affect neuroplasticity after acute and chronic administration. While, these effects were similar across psychedelic classes and the dissociative ketamine, LSD was most potent. Additional experiments with DMT also showed these morphological changes, even after the administration of low DMT doses that are considered to be sub‐hallucinogenic. The latter is important in light of the increased scientific interest in using low psychedelic doses, also known as 'microdosing'. Despite preclinical evidence for psychedelic‐induced neuroplasticity, confirmation in humans is grossly lacking. Given the interest in brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a key player in several neurodegenerative andneuropsychiatric disorders, and the preclinical data showing psychedelics‐induced neuroplasticity, even in low doses of psychedelics, the present, double‐blind placebo‐controlled, within‐subjects study aimed to investigate whether LSD in low doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 mcg) affects BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were recreational psychedelic users (N=24, both sexes) who provided informed consent, fell within the inclusion criteria, and passed medical screening including standard blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, prior to inclusion. Test days were scheduled with minimally five days in between. LSD (5, 10, and 20 mcg LSD base, dissolved in 96% Vol ethanol) or placebo (1 mL of ethanol) was administered orally in the morning (10:00 AM). Blood samples were collected every two hours over a six‐hour period, and BDNF levels were determined afterwards in blood plasma using ELISA. Difficulties with the peripheral venous catheter during blood sample collection resulted in missing data. Four trapezoidal areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated for the three LSD doses and placebo. The study adhered to the code of ethics on human experimentation, it was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and Maastricht University, and registered in the Dutch Clinical Trial register (number: NTR7102 https://www.trialregister.nl/). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. Complete within‐subjects cases (N(5 mcg)=10; N(10 mcg)= 9; N (20 mcg)=8) entered statistical analyses. Non‐parametric Wilcoxon signed‐rank (S‐R) tests for related samples (placebo versus LSD dose) were conducted on BDNF AUC's, and on BDNF plasma levels at ‐0.5h, +2h, +4h and +6h after dose administration of 5, 10 and 20 mcg LSD. Separate Friedman tests per treatment condition were performed to test at which timepoint LSD differed statistically from placebo. In case of a main effect Dunn's tests for pairwise comparisons including baseline versus 2h, 4h, and 6h, 2h‐4h, and 4h‐6h were conducted. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are given in case of statistically significant effects at alpha= 0.05. The alpha level was corrected for multiple comparisons with sequential Bonferroni in case of Dunn's tests. Results: Wilcoxon Signed‐Rank (S‐R) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 (Z= ‐2.60, p= 0.009, r= 0.58, 95% CI [0.11‐1.06]) and 20 mcg LSD (Z= ‐2.52, p= 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.09‐1.17]) compared to placebo; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant (Z= ‐1.01, p=0.31). Wilcoxon S‐R tests revealed higher BDNF levels at +4h after administration of 5 (Z= ‐2.80, p< 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.15‐1.11]) and 10 mcg LSD (Z= ‐1.95, p= 0.05, r= 0.46, 95% [‐0.04‐0.97]) compared to placebo. The latter CI included zero, indicating non‐significance. Tests at +6h after LSD administration revealed significant effects of 5 (Z= ‐2.29, p= 0.02, = 0.51, 95% CI [0.03‐0.99]) and 20 mcg (Z= ‐2.52, p= 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.09‐1.17]) LSD compared to placebo. Friedman tests investigating BDNF changes in function of time demonstrated that BDNF plasma levels remained stable in the placebo conditions throughout the test frame. BDNF plasma levels in the LSD conditions showed their highest levels at four hours after administration of 5 mcg LSD (8.95 ng/mL), and at 6 hours after administration of 10 mcg (8.28 ng/mL) and 20 mcg of LSD (11 49 ng/mL). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that low doses of LSD increase BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers up to 6 hours after administration, suggesting a window of opportunity for therapeutic response and/or and cognitive enhancement that might be of use in patient populations. This line of thinking is supported by recent findings with ketamine and ayahuasca (containing the psychedelic DMT) demonstrating increased serum BDNF levels respectively 24 and 48 hours after a single dose, compared to placebo, which was related to fast antidepressant actions. Besides emphasizing the need to sample BDNF beyond the elimination stage, in addition to including behavioral and/or imaging measures, future studies could focus on similarities between underlying biological pathways of the well‐studied ketamine, and LSD, as it will contribute to understanding the scope of effects LSD, might have, based on ketamine findings.","***TASK***

7078,"A Novel, Brief, Fully Automated Intervention to Extend the Antidepressant Effect of a Single Ketamine Infusion: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Intravenous ketamine, which displays rapid antidepressant properties, is posited to reverse depression by rapidly enhancing neuroplasticity. The authors tested whether an automated, computer-based approach could efficiently leverage enhanced neuroplasticity to extend the durability of rapid clinical response. METHODS: A total of 154 adults (ages 18-60) with treatment-resistant unipolar depression were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-arm design to receive an active/active treatment combination (ketamine plus active ""automated self-association training"" [ASAT]; N=53) or one of two control arms that lacked either the active drug component (saline plus active ASAT; N=51) or the active behavioral component (ketamine plus sham ASAT; N=50). One day after a single infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or inert placebo (saline), active ASAT-targeting self-worth through automated ""evaluative conditioning"" training delivered by computer-or sham ASAT (consisting of identical computer tasks that included no positive or self-referential stimuli) was given, delivered twice daily over 4 consecutive days (eight sessions, ≤20 minutes per session). The prespecified primary outcome measure throughout the main (30-day) study period was score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Ketamine rapidly and significantly reduced depression scores at 24 hours postinfusion (group-by-time interaction: standardized beta [β]=-1.30, 95% CI=-1.89, -0.70; t=-4.29, df=150). In intent-to-treat linear mixed models, depression scores in the ketamine+ASAT group remained significantly and stably low over the 30-day study period relative to those of the saline+ASAT group (β=-0.61, 95% CI=-0.95, -0.28; t=-3.62, df=148). By contrast, depression scores following ketamine+sham treatment followed a significant, increasing linear trajectory from 24 hours to 30 days, approaching the levels observed in the saline+ASAT group (group-by-time interaction relative to the saline+ASAT group: β=0.015, 95% CI=0.003, 0.03; t=2.35, df=568). CONCLUSIONS: After priming the brain with ketamine, training positive self-associations could provide an efficient, low-cost, portable, noninvasive, and highly dissemination-ready strategy for leveraging and extending ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects.","***TASK***

INPUT: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Brief, Fully Automated, Internet-Based Intervention for Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: The authors tested the efficacy of a brief, fully automated, Internet-based intervention for depression. METHODS: A total of 222 adults with elevated depressive symptoms were randomized to receive either the intervention (n=111) or a wait-list control (n=111). The intervention consisted of 5 brief, fully automated, Internet-based modules that were delivered over 2 weeks. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at 2 weeks. RESULTS: The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms than the control group at 2 weeks (mean difference=1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.9-2.7, p<.001). The intervention group also showed significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms than the control group at 1 month (mean difference=1.6, 95% CI=0.6-2.6, p=.002) and 3 months (mean difference=1.4, 95% CI=0.4-2.4, p=.007).

Human case reports and animal literature suggest dependence potential, although there may be some unique aspects to this syndrome for ecstasy in comparison to other substances. The Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) was examined to determine whether this could usefully identify 'dependent' ecstasy consumers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1,658 frequent (at least monthly) ecstasy consumers across Australia, assessing drug use, associated harms and risk behaviours. Dependence was evaluated with the SDS, using a cut-off of ≥4 to identify potential 'dependence'. Results: One fifth of the participants were screened as potentially dependent. These individuals used ecstasy more frequently, in greater amounts, engaged more extensively in risk behaviours and reported greater role interference than other participants.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). The subjective effects of psilocybin were assessed using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. Autonomic effects were assessed using heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance level (SCL).

Despite the importance of altered bodily self‐perception in disorders such as anorexia nervosa or depression, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. Methods: Fifteen healthy humans participated in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject study. Participants received Placebo or Psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg body weight). A Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task was conducted while participants underwent simultaneous EEG/fMRI scanning. FMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model. Global field power and event‐related potentials were analyzed. Results: Psilocybin reduced the BOLD signal in the Deviant > Standard contrast in the prefrontal cortex (p<0.05, FWE corrected). A significant interaction between treatment condition and stimulus type was revealed for the frontal electrode AF2 (F(1, 14) = 5.129, p < 0.05) with a significant difference between Standard and Deviant in the Placebo condition, but not in the Psilocybin condition. A significant positive correlation was found between Psilocybin‐induced “Disembodiment” and the mean amplitude of the EEG difference wave in the Psilocybin condition (r = 0.630, p = 0.012). Conclusions: These results show that a disruption of tactile prediction error processing in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie changes in bodily self‐perception. This seems to be driven by increased salience attribution to non‐salient stimuli under psilocybin. Together these results shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of altered bodily self‐perception and may therefore highlight important therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered bodily self‐perception body perception such as anorexia nervosa and depression.

2053,"The effects of intranasal esketamine on on-road driving performance in patients with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder.^\nBackground: Intranasal esketamine demonstrates rapid improvement of depressive symptoms. However, transient adverse effects (dissociation, sedation and dizziness) may occur, which could impact driving performance. Aims: To evaluate the effects of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on driving performance in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) or persistent depressive disorder (PDD) patients. Methods: The study consisted of two parts. Part A was a single-blind, double-dummy, randomized three-period, cross-over study to compare effects of esketamine versus placebo on next morning driving, 18 ± 2 h post-treatment. Alcohol was administered to demonstrate assay sensitivity. In Part B, same-day driving, 6 ± 0.5 hours post-treatment, was assessed during twice weekly esketamine administration for 3 weeks. Twenty-seven patients with mild-to-moderate MDD or PDD without psychotic features completed a 100 km on-the-road driving test on a public highway in normal traffic.

INPUT: The effects of intranasal esketamine on on-road driving performance in patients with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder.^\nBackground: Intranasal esketamine demonstrates rapid improvement of depressive symptoms. However, transient adverse effects (dissociation, sedation and dizziness) may occur, which could impact driving performance. Aims: To evaluate the effects of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on driving performance in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) or persistent depressive disorder (PDD) patients. Methods: The study consisted of two parts. Part A was a single-blind, double-dummy, randomized three-period, cross-over study to compare effects of esketamine versus placebo on next morning driving, 18 ± 2 h post-treatment. Alcohol was administered to demonstrate assay sensitivity. In Part B, same-day driving, 6 ± 0.5 hours post-treatment, was assessed during twice weekly esketamine administration for 3 weeks. Twenty-seven patients with mild-to-moderate MDD or PDD without psychotic features completed a 100 km on-the-road driving test on a public highway in normal traffic. The primary outcome was standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP; cm; weaving of car). Results: In Part A, alcohol impaired driving performance compared to placebo: Least-square means (95% CI), p-value for delta SDLP (cm) compared with placebo: (ΔSDLP = + 1.83 (1.03; 2.62), p < 0.001), whereas esketamine did not: (ΔSDLP = −0.23 (−1.04; 0.58), p = 0.572).

6044,"Psilocybin-facilitated Smoking Cessation Treatment: a Pilot Study.^\nOne of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence. We propose to examine psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this combined treatment for smoking cessation. Prior work in our laboratory has shown that under carefully prepared and supportive conditions, psilocybin administration can facilitate highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008). It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for remaining abstinent. Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. More specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine‐dependent cigarette smokers, who have had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts, and who continue to desire to quit smoking. Other than nicotine dependence, participants will be healthy. Fifteen participants have already completed a preliminary open‐label pilot‐study with no control condition. Eighty additional participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin (n=40), or nicotine patch (n=40) treatment. Participants will receive a 13‐week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation, with Target Quit Date set for week 5. After several preparation meetings with study monitors, participants will have either a single day‐long psilocybin session using a high dose (30 mg/70 kg), or a standard 8 to 10‐week course of nicotine patch treatment. Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the Target Quit Date, including biological verification of smoking status through breath and urine samples. Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the Target Quit Date. Additionally, 50 of these participants (25 per treatment condition) will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain‐based mechanisms associated with these treatments.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of psilocybin on the subjective experience of pain: an exploratory study.^\nPsilocybin is a hallucinogenic substance that has been used in the treatment of cluster headaches. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on the subjective experience of pain. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) or placebo. The subjective experience of pain was assessed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

5812,"Ecstasy (MDMA): Are the psychological problems associated with its use reversed by prolonged abstinence?.^\nRationale: Chronic, regular recreational use of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with psychopathology, elevated behavioural impulsivity and persistent impairment of memory performance. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate which of these sequelae persist after at least 6 months of abstinence from ecstasy.Methods: Four groups of participants were compared: 18 current regular recreational ecstasy users, 15 ex-regular ecstasy users who had abstained from using the drug for an average of 2 years, 16 polydrug users who had never taken ecstasy and 15 drug-naive controls. Results: There were no significant group differences in age, education level, or pre-morbid intelligence and, generally, the use of illicit drugs other than ecstasy was not significantly different among the three drug-using groups. Both current and ex-ecstasy users exhibited elevated psychopathology and behavioural impulsivity compared with polydrug users and drug-naive controls, but current ecstasy users exhibited a broader range of psychopathology than ex-users. Both groups of ecstasy users also exhibited impaired working memory and verbal recall performance compared with drug-naive controls, but only ex-users exhibited impaired verbal recall relative to polydrug users. Regression analysis indicated that psychopathology was primarily predicted by the extent of previous consumption of cannabis rather than ecstasy, whereas the majority of the cognitive deficits were only predicted by the extent of previous ecstasy use. Conclusions: Selective impairments of neuro-psychological performance associated with regular ecstasy use are not reversed by prolonged abstinence. This is consistent with evidence that ecstasy has potent and selective neurotoxic effects on brain serotonergic systems in humans.","***TASK***

Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate which of these sequelae persist after at least 6 months of abstinence from ecstasy.Methods: Four groups of participants were compared: 18 current regular recreational ecstasy users, 15 ex-regular ecstasy users who had abstained from using the drug for an average of 2 years, 16 polydrug users who had never taken ecstasy and 15 drug-naive controls. Results: There were no significant group differences in age, education level, or pre-morbid intelligence and, generally, the use of illicit drugs other than ecstasy was not significantly different among the three drug-using groups. Both current and ex-ecstasy users exhibited elevated psychopathology and behavioural impulsivity compared with polydrug users and drug-naive controls, but current ecstasy users exhibited a broader range of psychopathology than ex-users. Both groups of ecstasy users also exhibited impaired working memory and verbal recall performance compared with drug-naive controls, but only ex-users exhibited impaired verbal recall relative to polydrug users. Regression analysis indicated that psychopathology was primarily predicted by the extent of previous consumption of cannabis rather than ecstasy, whereas the majority of the cognitive deficits were only predicted by the extent of previous ecstasy use. Conclusions: Selective impairments of neuro-psychological performance associated with regular ecstasy use are not reversed by prolonged abstinence. This is consistent with evidence that ecstasy has potent and selective neurotoxic effects on brain serotonergic systems in humans.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans.^\nRationale: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that is used recreationally and therapeutically. 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a serotonergic hallucinogen that is used recreationally and is thought to be a component of the psychoactive effects of ayahuasca. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans.Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before receiving a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). The subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin were assessed at baseline and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

INPUT: A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the sexual health of women living with HIV.^\nBackground: Women living with HIV (WLWH) are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 2016. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) of interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH. We excluded studies of interventions to prevent HIV acquisition. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate pooled effect sizes. Results: We included 12 RCTs and 2 CBAs. Interventions included behavioral interventions (n = 7), biomedical interventions (n = 4), and a combination of behavioral and biomedical interventions (n = 3). The majority of studies were conducted in the United States (n = 9). The risk of bias was high in 6 RCTs and 1 CBA. The pooled effect size for behavioral interventions was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.01 to 0.51; I2 = 0%). The pooled effect size for biomedical interventions was 0.14 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.29; I2 = 0%). The pooled effect size for combined behavioral and biomedical interventions was 0.16 (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.33; I2 = 0%). Conclusions: Behavioral, biomedical, and combined behavioral and biomedical interventions may improve the sexual health of WLWH. However, the quality of the evidence is low. Future studies should use rigorous study designs and report on the impact of interventions on sexual health outcomes.

1989,"Spatial Correspondence of LSD-Induced Variations on Brain Functioning at Rest With Serotonin Receptor Expression.^\nBACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is an atypical psychedelic compound that exerts its effects through pleiotropic actions, mainly involving 1A/2A serotoninergic (5-HT) receptor subtypes. However, the mechanisms by which LSD promotes a reorganization of the brain's functional activity and connectivity are still partially unknown. METHODS: Our study analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 15 healthy volunteers undergoing LSD single-dose intake. A voxelwise analysis investigated the alterations of the brain's intrinsic functional connectivity and local signal amplitude induced by LSD or by a placebo. Quantitative comparisons assessed the spatial overlap between these 2 indices of functional reorganization and the topography of receptor expression obtained from a publicly available collection of in vivo, whole-brain atlases. Finally, linear regression models explored the relationships between changes in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral aspects of the psychedelic experience. RESULTS: LSD elicited modifications of the cortical functional architecture that spatially overlapped with the distribution of serotoninergic receptors. Local signal amplitude and functional connectivity increased in regions belonging to the default mode and attention networks associated with high expression of 5-HT(2A) receptors. These functional changes correlate with the occurrence of simple and complex visual hallucinations. At the same time, a decrease in local signal amplitude and intrinsic connectivity was observed in limbic areas, which are dense with 5-HT(1A) receptors.

We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of single-dose i.v. ketamine augmentation of escitalopram in major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Thirty outpatients with severe MDD (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score ⩾ 24) were randomized to 4 weeks double-blind treatment with escitalopram 10 mg/day+single-dose i.v. ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) or escitalopram 10 mg/day + placebo (0.9% i.v. saline). Depressive symptoms were measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Report (QIDS-SR). Suicidal ideation was evaluated with the QIDS-SR item 12. Adverse psychopathological effects were measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-positive symptoms, Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Patients were assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 24 and 72 h and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Time to response (⩾ 50% MADRS score reduction) was the primary outcome. RESULTS: By 4 weeks, more escitalopram + ketamine-treated than escitalopram + placebo-treated patients responded (92.3% v. 57.1%, p = 0.04) and remitted (76.9% v. 14.3%, p = 0.001), with significantly shorter time to response [hazard ratio (HR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.22, p < 0.001] and remission (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.63, p = 0.01). Compared to escitalopram + placebo, escitalopram + ketamine was associated with significantly lower MADRS scores from 2 h to 2 weeks [(peak = 3 days-2 weeks; effect size (ES) = 1.08-1.18)], QIDS-SR scores from 2 h to 2 weeks (maximum ES = 1.27), and QIDS-SR suicidality from 2 to 72 h (maximum ES = 2.24). Only YMRS scores increased significantly with ketamine augmentation (1 and 2 h), without significant BPRS or CADSS elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose i.v. ketamine augmentation of escitalopram was safe and effective in severe MDD, holding promise for speeding up early oral antidepressant efficacy.","***TASK***

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous infusion of ketamine in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). METHOD: Twenty-four patients with OCD were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score at 24 hours. Secondary outcome measures included the Y-BOCS score at 1 week, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) at 24 hours and 1 week. RESULTS: The mean Y-BOCS score at 24 hours was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (p =.02). The mean Y-BOCS score at 1 week was also significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (p =.02). The mean CGI-I score at 1 week was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (p =.02). The mean HAM-D score at 24 hours was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (p =.02). The mean HAM-D score at 1 week was also significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (p =.02). CONCLUSIONS: A single intravenous infusion of ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in OCD symptoms and depressive symptoms at 24 hours and 1 week. Ketamine was well tolerated. These findings suggest that ketamine may be a promising treatment for OCD.

2863,"Cessation and reduction in alcohol consumption and misuse after psychedelic use.^\nBACKGROUND: Meta-analysis of randomized studies using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) for alcohol use disorder (AUD) showed large, significant effects for LSD efficacy compared to control conditions. Clinical studies suggest potential anti-addiction effects of LSD and mechanistically-related classic psychedelics for alcohol and other substance use disorders. AIMS: To supplement clinical studies, reports of psychedelic use in naturalistic settings can provide further data regarding potential effects of psychedelics on alcohol use. METHODS: An anonymous online survey of individuals with prior AUD reporting cessation or reduction in alcohol use following psychedelic use in non-clinical settings. RESULTS: 343 respondents, mostly White (89%), males (78%), in the USA (60%) completed the survey. Participants reported seven years of problematic alcohol use on average before the psychedelic experience to which they attributed reduced alcohol consumption, with 72% meeting retrospective criteria for severe AUD. Most reported taking a moderate or high dose of LSD (38%) or psilocybin (36%), followed by significant reduction in alcohol consumption. After the psychedelic experience 83% no longer met AUD criteria. Participants rated their psychedelic experience as highly meaningful and insightful, with 28% endorsing psychedelic-associated changes in life priorities or values as facilitating reduced alcohol misuse. Greater psychedelic dose, insight, mystical-type effects, and personal meaning of experiences were associated with a greater reduction in alcohol consumption, controlling for prior alcohol consumption and related distress.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of psilocybin on cognitive and emotional measures of alcoholism^\nBackground: Alcoholism is a chronic relapsing disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current treatment options for alcoholism are limited in their efficacy and are associated with significant side effects. Psilocybin is a classic hallucinogen that has been shown to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on cognitive and emotional measures of alcoholism. Methods: A single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) was administered to 15 alcohol-dependent subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Subjects were assessed on a battery of cognitive and emotional measures before and after psilocybin administration. Results: Psilocybin administration was associated with a significant reduction in craving for alcohol and a significant increase in the number of days abstinent from alcohol. Psilocybin administration was also associated with a significant increase in the number of days abstinent from alcohol.

We aimed to examine the sustained effects of six consecutive ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with major depressive disorder were eligible to receive augmentation with six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) administered over the course of 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The coprimary outcome measures were the rates of response and remission as measured on the 10-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Psychotomimetic and dissociative symptoms were measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-positive symptoms and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, respectively. RESULTS: After the first ketamine infusion, only 10 (13.0%) and 6 (7.8%) patients responded and remitted, respectively; after six ketamine infusions, 52 (67.5%) patients responded and 37 (48.1%) remitted. There was a significant mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at four hours after the first ketamine infusion (7.0±7.5, p<0.001), and this decrease was maintained for the duration of the infusion period. The response to ketamine treatment was positively associated with no history of psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratio=3.56, p=0.009).

Nonresponders who received placebo on day 1 were randomly assigned again 1:1 to IV esketamine .20 mg/kg or .40 mg/kg on day 4. Secondary efficacy and safety measures were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients, 97% (29 of 30) completed the study. The least squares mean changes (SE) from baseline to day 2 in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score for the esketamine .20 mg/kg and .40 mg/kg dose groups were -16.8 (3.00) and -16.9 (2.61), respectively, and showed significant improvement (one-sided p = .001 for both groups) compared with placebo (-3.8 [2.97]). Esketamine showed a rapid (within 2 hours) and robust antidepressant effect. Treatment-emergent adverse events were dose dependent. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, nausea, and dissociation; the last-mentioned was transient and did not persist beyond 4 hours from the start of the esketamine infusion.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is sensitive to the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 minutes after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02) and decreased the latency of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have a direct effect on the P300 ERP, which may be related to its antidepressant effects.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans. However, interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size. Additionally, OXTR SNPs did not moderate the subjective overall effect of MDMA (any drug effect) or feelings of ""closeness to others"".

5048,"Repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine: Neurocognition in patients with anxious and nonanxious treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. METHOD: Patients with anxious (n = 30) and nonanxious TRD (n = 20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. RESULTS: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p < 0.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p = 0.028). However, no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD. Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD, and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is sensitive to the effects of antidepressant medications. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHOD: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (normal saline) intravenously. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP (p = 0.001) and decreased the latency of the P300 ERP (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ketamine may have a positive effect on cognitive function in healthy volunteers.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

INPUT: The effect of the menstrual cycle on the response to a standardized stressor.^\nThe effect of the menstrual cycle on the response to a standardized stressor was studied in 12 healthy women. The stressor was a 5-min speech task. The women were tested on 3 occasions, once during the follicular phase, once during the luteal phase, and once during the midluteal phase. The speech task was preceded by a 5-min baseline period and followed by a 5-min recovery period. The women were videotaped during the speech task and the recovery period. The videotapes were scored for speech content and for nonverbal behavior. The women also completed a questionnaire about their mood and anxiety during the speech task. The results showed that the women were more anxious during the speech task in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. The women also showed more nonverbal behavior indicative of anxiety in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. The women's speech content was more negative in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. The women's speech content was also more negative in the midluteal phase than in the follicular phase. The results suggest that the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with increased anxiety and negative affect in response to a standardized stressor. (18 references).

Ayahuasca administration was associated with increased psychoactivity (Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale) and significant score decreases in depression-related scales (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) from 80 minutes to day 21. Increased blood perfusion in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area, brain regions implicated in the regulation of mood and emotions, were observed after ayahuasca intake. Ayahuasca was well tolerated. Vomiting was the only adverse effect recorded, being reported by 47% of the volunteers. Our results suggest that ayahuasca may have fast-acting and sustained antidepressive properties. These results should be replicated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ayahuasca on regional cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers studied by perfusion SPECT.^\nAyahuasca is a botanical hallucinogenic brew used in religious rituals by indigenous populations of the Amazon basin. It contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a 5-HT2A receptor agonist, and harmine, a monoamine-oxidase A inhibitor. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ayahuasca on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers. rCBF was measured by perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 10 healthy volunteers before and 8 h after the ingestion of a single dose of ayahuasca (2.2 mL/kg). The SPECT images were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and regions of interest (ROI) methods. The SPM analysis showed increased rCBF in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula and left subgenual area. The ROI analysis showed increased rCBF in the left nucleus accumbens, right insula, left subgenual area, left anterior cingulate cortex, left thalamus, left caudate nucleus, left putamen, left hippocampus, left amygdala, left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left lingual gyrus, left cerebellum, right anterior cingulate cortex, right thalamus, right caudate nucleus, right putamen, right hippocampus, right amygdala, right parahippocampal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, right lingual gyrus, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum, left cerebellum, right cerebellum,",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.","***TASK***

Ketamine has a robust antidepressant effect, but there are no reported studies of ketamine for depression relapse prevention. This pilot trial (NCT02414932) was designed to assess feasibility of the proposed trial protocol, including examining reasons for nonrecruitment, nonrandomization, and dropout. METHODS: Patients with unipolar depression referred for ECT were monitored weekly for therapeutic response, using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (monitoring phase). Those who met standard response criteria were invited to be randomized to a course of 4 once-weekly infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or the active comparator, midazolam (0.045 mg/kg), over 40 minutes to examine trial processes (treatment phase). Participants were followed up for 6 months after ECT to assess for relapse. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five referrals were screened over 18 months, and 68% of eligible participants (n = 43) were recruited to the monitoring phase; 60.5% of participants met ECT response criteria (n = 26), but only 26% (6) of these consented to take part in the treatment phase.

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted. Twenty patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the pain threshold measured by the pressure algometer. The secondary outcomes were the pain intensity measured by the visual analog scale, the pain unpleasantness measured by the visual analog scale, and the processing of pain-related words measured by the Stroop test. RESULTS: The pain threshold was significantly higher in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (P = 0.001). The pain intensity and the pain unpleasantness were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).

Recent ecstasy/MDMA users who had taken other drugs (mainly cannabis) 48-24 h before testing exhibited poorer declarative memory than controls, but recent users who had not taken other drugs in this 48-24-h period did not differ from controls. Greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy, and of cocaine, were associated with greater deficits in declarative memory. These results suggest that procedural, as well as declarative, memory deficits are associated with the extent of past ecstasy use. However, ecstasy/MDMA did not affect the memory consolidation function of sleep for either the declarative or the procedural memory task. © The Author(s) 2010.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective experience of time.^\nThe subjective experience of time is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. The present study investigated the effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective experience of time. 5-MeO-DMT is a psychedelic tryptamine that is known to induce profound alterations in the subjective experience of time. The study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Participants (n = 20) received either 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The subjective experience of time was assessed using the Time Experience Questionnaire (TEQ). The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective experience of time. The effect of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time was dose-dependent. The results of the present study suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may be a useful tool for investigating the subjective experience of time. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

6643,"The effects of psilocybin on brain EEG activity and connectivity in healthy volunteers-focus on the dynamics of the psychedelic state.^\nIntroduction.‐ A serotonin 5‐HT2A/C agonist, psychedelic drug psilocybin, is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression. Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects, continuous data are lacking. Objectives.‐ We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters, brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin. Methods.‐ Twenty healthy volunteers (10 M/10F, 28‐50yrs) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial. A standard 19 channel EEG (registered before and 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) ingestion), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session, a subjective scale “altered scale of consciousness scale (ASCs)” at the end of measurements. Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Results.‐ Psilocybin induced psychotic‐like symptoms, especially changes in perception and thought disturbances, peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels. Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects. The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band, but increased in all other frequency bands at peak, however, six hours after ingestion, the effects were inverted. Conclusions.‐ The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).","***TASK***

While body weight-adjusted dosing is widely used, this imposes a practical and financial strain on the scalability of psychedelic therapy. This gap between evidence and practice is caused by the absence of studies clarifying the relationship between BMI, the acute psychedelic experience and long-term psychological outcomes.

Results: Results support the null hypothesis that BMI does not predict overall intensity of the altered state, mystical experiences, perceptual changes or emotional breakthroughs during the acute experience.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine. DESIGN: Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced-order design. In the first experiment, the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo. In the second experiment, pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release. SETTING: Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Manchester, England. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three healthy, right-handed men were recruited by advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: In experiment 1, participants were given intravenous ketamine (1-minute bolus of 0.26 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for the remainder of the session) or placebo (0.9% saline solution). In experiment 2, participants were pretreated with 300 mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale scores. RESULTS: Ketamine induced a rapid, focal, and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex, including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate, which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid-posterior cingulate, thalamus, and temporal cortical regions (r = 0.90). Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores. Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms.

The perception of pain was measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the autonomic nervous system was measured by the heart rate, blood pressure, and the skin temperature. RESULTS: The VAS score was significantly decreased after the administration of morphine. The heart rate was significantly decreased after the administration of morphine. The blood pressure was significantly decreased after the administration of morphine. The skin temperature was significantly decreased after the administration of morphine. CONCLUSION: A single dose of 5 mg of intravenous morphine decreased the perception of pain and the autonomic nervous system in healthy volunteers.

6683,"Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the longitudinal treatment of juvenile bipolar disorder with fear of harm phenotype.^\nOBJECTIVES: Fear of Harm (FOH) is a pediatric onset phenotype of bipolar disorder (BD) characterized by BD plus treatment resistance, separation anxiety, aggressive obsessions, parasomnias, and thermal dysregulation. Intranasal ketamine (InK) in 12 youths with BD-FOH produced marked improvement during a two-week trial. Here we report on the open effectiveness and safety of InK in maintenance treatment of BD-FOH from the private practice of one author. METHODS: As part of a chart review, patients 18 years or older and parents of younger children responded to a clinical effectiveness and safety survey. Effectiveness was assessed from analysis of responses to 49 questions on symptomatology plus qualitative content analyses of written reports and chart review. Adverse events (AEs) were analyzed by frequency, duration and severity. Peak InK doses ranged from 20 to 360mg per administration. RESULTS: Surveys were completed on 45 patients treated with InK for 3 months to 6.5 years. Almost all patients were ""much"" to ""very much"" improved clinically and in ratings of social function and academic performance. Significant reductions were reported in all symptom categories. There were 13 reports of persistent AEs, none of which resulted in discontinuation. Acute emergence reactions were sporadically observed in up to 75%, but were mild and of brief duration. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective review from a single practice without placebo control with potential for response and recall bias. CONCLUSIONS: InK every 3-4 days at sub-anesthetic doses appeared to be a beneficial and well-tolerated treatment. Use of InK may be considered as a tertiary alternative in treatment refractory cases.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intranasal ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intranasal ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either intranasal ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed before and 40 min after drug administration. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces (happy, sad, fearful, angry, and neutral) and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the intensity of the emotional response to the faces. This was associated with a significant increase in the activation of the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to the faces. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine may be mediated by an increase in the intensity of emotional processing, which is associated with increased activation of the amygdala, insula, and ACC.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

6148,"A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Music for Suicidal Ideation.^\nKetamine is a glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist traditionally used as a general anesthetic. Recent double blinded randomized control trials of intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions have been well‐tolerated and demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect, most notably in subjects with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) and treatment‐resistant bipolar depression. Significance. The outcomes of current therapy for depression are poor, with roughly a third of patient's failing to improve or regressing. The patients are high risk for suicide and the need for rapid acting, durable treatments for reduction of suicidal ideation is paramount. Ketamine has been shown to improve suicidal ideation for at least 6 weeks in the largest study of ketamine for SI to date in subjects recruited to participate in the clinical trial and admitted to a research facility. We intend to test ketamine in a more pragmatic trial in the ER in patients who are not actively recruited, but report SI to ER staff or have SI as a chief complaint. Research Aims. Overview. In the current open label randomized control trial, we will examine the suicidal ideation reducing efficacy of IV ketamine combined with music and treatment as usual in four groups. All four groups will receive treatment as usual as defined above (potential hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, outpatient referrals, suicide safety planning). A factorial design is being implemented to test two interventions independently and combined: ketamine and music. One group will receive IV ketamine 0.5mg/kg infused over forty minutes with one hour of pre‐planned music will be compared to 3 other groups: One group will receive the same dose of ketamine without music, one group will one hour of music without ketamine, and one group will receive neither music nor ketamine. During the 4‐week follow up interval, subjects from both groups will be contacted by phone for weekly assessment of depression, SI and quality of life. A playlist by composer Nils Frahm will be played for 60 minutes. The music is instrumental, relaxing and subjectively thought to be uplifting by patients who have listened to the music during ketamine infusions performed previously by the PI for treatment of resistant depression. Music can be previewed at the link below: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVbGPBkXJYHF Patients will be screened for study entry by the emergency room (ER) treating physician who will be available 24 hours a day who will notify the clinical trials research staff that a subject is available to be screened. Dr. Robert Creath Er attending will be the primary coordinator of Er services. The clinical trials staff that will be assigned to the project by the UTHET north campus department of clinical research. will then screen the subject for entry to the study, and perform the informed consent process. The subject will then be randomized by clinical trials staff using block randomization to each group. A 1:1 assignment to each group will be implemented with permuted blocks between 4 and 6 with equal probability. Patients entering the study will be voluntarily admitted to the hospital or monitored in the ER for a minimum of 2 hours after the first IV ketamine or music treatment and discharged when deemed to not be a suicide risk by a treating physician. A driver will be required to take the subject home if discharged the same day as the ketamine treatment. Subjects deemed to be a continued risk to themselves or others will be admitted as per clinician discretion which is considered treatment as usual. The ER nurse will be administering the sub‐anesthetic dose of ketamine. Vital signs including, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation will be monitored at fifteen‐minute intervals during the infusion, and will be recorded for 30 minutes after the infusion at fifteen minute intervals. Subjects will be followed up by phone at weekly intervals and voluntary hospitalization will be recommended for patients with SSI score of ≥4. Psychotropic medications w ll be adjusted and optimized at the discretion of the treating physicians at study entry. Medications may be modified during the 4‐week study interval in line with standard practice. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants. Informed consent will be obtained in person when possible or by the Teams telemedicine app when necessary if research staff is unavailable on site. The primary outcome measure of this study will be treatment response, defined as a ≥50% score reduction in the SSI from baseline to 4 weeks after the first ketamine injection. Remission will be defined as a ≥50% reduction in SSI score with score ≤4. The SSI will be administered at baseline, prior to each treatment and 24 hours after IV ketamine administration, then every week during the symptom monitoring follow‐up period of 4 weeks. The clinician‐rated SSI assesses current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). Medications may be adjusted during the study interval. Secondary outcome will be change in MADRS and SSI score from baseline to 4 weeks after the treatment. Raters will be blinded to the subject treatment group. During the 4‐week follow up participants will be contacted by phone with follow‐up questions regarding their overall health status, mood and clinical state using MADRS, SSI, QIDS and other clinical scales listed below. Study/Design. Patients with clinically documented depression with SI will be screened for diagnosis of depressive episode with the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a structured interview of psychiatric disorders, at baseline to establish the presence of a major depressive episode. The depressive episode could be associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or substance induced depressive disorder. Procedure Portable speakers will be provided playing relaxing music prior to and during the administration of ketamine for groups 2 and 3 (Nils Frahm playlist‐modern classical composer). This music has been previously used at Christus Mother Francis for therapeutic ketamine use with good results. Subjects will be inform that music can be stopped by request at any time. Informed consent and screening will be performed in the UTHET north campus clinical trials staff at initial presentation. Follow up assessments during weeks 1‐4 will be done by phone. Clinical research staff will randomize subjects to treatment groups as documented above. Ketamine IV will be supplied by the UT Health East Texas pharmacy. The administration of ketamine will be initiated by the emergency room nurse with ACLS certified physician supervision. Prior to the treatment, patients will be undergo psychiatric interview by the University of Texas Health center at Tyler psychiatric ER consult liaison team as per standard practice. An ACLS certified physician will be nearby in the ER post‐procedure for 1 hour or until a clinician deems patient is clinically stable. We plan on utilizing the monitoring protocol advised by the American Psychiatric Association consensus statement: ""(1) assessment of respiratory status (i.e., oxygen saturation or end‐tidal CO2); (2) assessment of cardiovascular function (blood pressure and heart rate, reported on a regular basis every 15 minutes); (3) assessment of the level of consciousness or other documented assessment of responsiveness; and (4) delineation of criteria for stopping the infusion and a clear plan for managing cardiovascular or behavioral events during treatment."" Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. The most common side effects associated with ketamine are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, double vision, drowsiness, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, anxiety, dissociation (feeling strange and disconnected from the world), and confusion. Delirium, hallucinations, and nightmares have been associated with high dose ketamine, but are not common side effects in subanesthetic ketamine treatment. The subanesthetic dose of 0.5 mg/kg has been documented to be safe and we l tolerated in numerous clinical trials in the treatment of suicidal thoughts. Rare but serious possible adverse event associated with ketamine include: Cardiac arrest, diabetes insipidus, anaphylaxis, ocular hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, arrythmia exacerbation or apnea. Digital pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be monitored throughout the injection at 15 minute intervals with a recovery period similar to recent study of IV ketamine for PTSD and TRD performed at the Minneapolis VA. Vital signs, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) will be assessed pre‐dose, at 40 minutes after ketamine infusion has started. Hypertensive emergency, respiratory failure or cardiac arrest is not known to have occurred in previous clinical trials of IV ketamine for treatment of depression. Emergency room physicians will be notified and render care in the event of unexpected medical emergencies. The infusions will be stopped if a patient requests stopping the infusion, becomes agitated, or goes into respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Medical emergencies will be managed by ACLS certified ER physicians. Code BERT will be called as necessary if a patient becomes acutely agitated and presents a danger to themselves or others. Medications will be optimized as per standard practice throughout the 4‐week study. Suicide safety plans, referrals to outpatient treatments will done as per standard practice. Participants will be directed to contact the nearest ER in case of emergency after initial hospital discharge. Participants will be contacted weekly during the 4‐week study period to review the patient's health status and administer clinical scales by phone. Clinical assessment. Informed consent will be obtained. This evaluation will obtain family history and demographic data. We will perform a urine drug screening (UDS) to rule out recent undisclosed use of illicit substances that may exclude subjects from the study. Demographic information is obtained through a standardized form and covers age, race, gender, education (information both on siblings and their parents), religion, and socioeconomic status. Participants will fill out the mood questionnaires rating the severity of the clinical symptoms. Participants will be asked about previous medications they have taken for mental health disorders and general medical conditions. Results will be stored in a secure location by the department of clinical research. Selected mood assessment questionnaires will be administered by our clinical research staff including the MINI Interview. This is the standard psychiatric research evaluation for ascertainment of psychiatric diagnosis in the context of research studies. It is a comprehensive structured interview for determining axis I diagnosis according to the DSM‐V to be administered at study entry and takes approximately 15 minutes. We will also use the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): this scale rates depressive symptoms, and its psychometric properties are well‐established. We will assess SI with the Suicidal Scale Instrument. The clinician‐rated SSI assessed current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). We will also assess dissociation with the Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS): Frequency of administration: After every treatment, to monitor the dissociative side effects status post infusion. Self‐report questionnaires to assess mood, and quality of life will include Quick inventory of depressive symptomatology QIDS‐SR to measure self‐reported depressive symptoms, weekly and the World health organization quality of life scale.","***TASK***

INPUT: A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Music for Suicidal Ideation.^\nKetamine is a glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist traditionally used as a general anesthetic. Recent double blinded randomized control trials of intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions have been well‐tolerated and demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect, most notably in subjects with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) and treatment‐resistant bipolar depression. Significance. The outcomes of current therapy for depression are poor, with roughly a third of patient's failing to improve or regressing. The patients are high risk for suicide and the need for rapid acting, durable treatments for reduction of suicidal ideation is paramount. Ketamine has been shown to improve suicidal ideation for at least 6 weeks in the largest study of ketamine for SI to date in subjects recruited to participate in the clinical trial and admitted to a research facility. We intend to test ketamine in a more pragmatic trial in the ER in patients who are not actively recruited, but report SI to ER staff or have SI as a chief complaint. Research Aims. Overview. In the current open label randomized control trial, we will examine the suicidal ideation reducing efficacy of IV ketamine combined with music and treatment as usual in four groups. All four groups will receive treatment as usual as defined above (potential hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, outpatient referrals, suicide safety planning). A factorial design is being implemented to test two interventions independently and combined: ketamine and music. One group will receive IV ketamine 0.5mg/kg infused over forty minutes with one hour of pre‐planned music will be compared to 3 other groups: One group will receive the same dose of ketamine without music, one group will one hour of music without ketamine, and one group will receive neither music nor ketamine. During the 4‐week follow up interval, subjects from both groups will be contacted by phone for weekly assessment of depression, SI and quality of life. A playlist by composer Nils Frahm will be played for 60 minutes. The music is instrumental, relaxing and subjectively thought to be uplifting by patients who have listened to the music during ketamine infusions performed previously by the PI for treatment of resistant depression. Music can be previewed at the link below: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVbGPBkXJYHF Patients will be screened for study entry by the emergency room (ER) treating physician who will be available 24 hours a day who will notify the clinical trials research staff that a subject is available to be screened. Dr. Robert Creath Er attending will be the primary coordinator of Er services. The clinical trials staff that will be assigned to the project by the UTHET north campus department of clinical research. will then screen the subject for entry to the study, and perform the informed consent process. The subject will then be randomized by clinical trials staff using block randomization to each group. A 1:1 assignment to each group will be implemented with permuted blocks between 4 and 6 with equal probability. Patients entering the study will be voluntarily admitted to the hospital or monitored in the ER for a minimum of 2 hours after the first IV ketamine or music treatment and discharged when deemed to not be a suicide risk by a treating physician. A driver will be required to take the subject home if discharged the same day as the ketamine treatment. Subjects deemed to be a continued risk to themselves or others will be admitted as per clinician discretion which is considered treatment as usual. The ER nurse will be administering the sub‐anesthetic dose of ketamine. Vital signs including, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation will be monitored at fifteen‐minute intervals during the infusion, and will be recorded for 30 minutes after the infusion at fifteen minute intervals.

9572,"Rapid and longer-term antidepressant effects of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine for patients with unipolar and bipolar depression.^\nObjective: Single-dose intravenous (IV) injection of ketamine has shown rapid but transient antidepressant effects. The strategy of repeated-dose ketamine infusions to maintain antidepressant effects has received little systematic study. This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of six ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Methods: Ninety seven patients with unipolar (n = 77) and bipolar (n = 20) depression received repeated ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) with continuous vital sign monitoring. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Suicidal ideation was assessed using the Scale for Suicidal Ideations (SSI)-part 1. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Adverse psychopathological and dissociative effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-positive symptoms and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), respectively. Patients were assessed at baseline, 4 and 24 h, and 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 26 days. Results: After six ketamine infusions, the response and remission rates were 68.0% and 50.5%, respectively. There were significant decreases in MADRS, SSI-part 1, and HAMA scores within four hours following the first ketamine infusion, and the decreases were sustained over the subsequent infusion period. The nonresponder subgroup manifested rapid significant improvement in suicidal ideations throughout the course of treatment. After the six ketamine infusions, the response was positively associated with the response at 24 h after the first infusion (OR = 8.94), personal income ≥4000 yuan/month (OR = 3.04), and no history of psychiatric hospitalization (OR = 3.41). Only CADSS scores had a mild but marginally significant increase after the first infusion but with a significant BPRS score decrease. Conclusion: Six ketamine infusions were safe and effective in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. The rapid and robust antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion within four hours were sustained following the subsequent infusions.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease.^\nBackground: Depression is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). The treatment of depression in PD is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the treatment of depression in patients with PD. Methods: A total of 30 patients with PD and depression were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the ketamine group (n = 15) and the placebo group (n = 15). The patients in the ketamine group received a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), and the patients in the placebo group received a single dose of intravenous normal saline. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety before and after the treatment. Results: The HAMD and HAMA scores of the patients in the ketamine group were significantly lower than those of the patients in the placebo group after the treatment (P < 0.05). The HAMD and HAMA scores of the patients in the ketamine group were significantly lower than those of the patients in the placebo group after the treatment (P < 0.05).

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anaesthetic agent for over 40 years. It has also been used as a treatment for depression, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in healthy volunteers. The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp electrodes in 12 healthy volunteers before and after a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). The EEG was analysed using a combination of time-frequency analysis and independent component analysis. Ketamine produced a significant increase in the power of the EEG in the theta and alpha frequency bands. The increase in theta power was most prominent in the frontal regions of the brain. The increase in alpha power was most prominent in the occipital regions of the brain. The increase in theta power was associated with a decrease in the power of the EEG in the beta frequency band. The increase in alpha power was associated with a decrease in the power of the EEG in the gamma frequency band. The increase in theta power was associated with a decrease in the power of the EEG in the gamma frequency band.

6103,"A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD.

INPUT: A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo.

INPUT: A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the sexual health of women living with HIV^\nBackground: Women living with HIV (WLWH) are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV transmission. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 2016. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) of interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH. We excluded studies of interventions to prevent HIV acquisition. We extracted data on study design, population, intervention, and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate pooled effect sizes. Results: We included 12 studies (n = 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) of interventions to improve the sexual health of WLWH. Interventions included behavioral interventions (n = 6), peer support (n = 2), and a combination of behavioral interventions and peer support (n = 4). Interventions were delivered in person (n = 6), by telephone (n = 3), or by both (n = 3). Interventions were delivered by nurses (n = 3), peer educators (n = 2), and a combination of nurses and peer educators (n = 7). Interventions were delivered in the United States (n = 5), Canada (n = 2), the United Kingdom (n = 2), Australia (n = 1), and South Africa (n = 2). Interventions were delivered in clinical settings (n = 6), community settings (n = 3), and both (n = 3). Interventions were delivered to WLWH only (n = 4), WLWH and their partners (n = 4), and WLWH and their partners and other sexual partners (n = 4). Interventions were delivered to WLWH with a history of STIs (n = 2), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners (n = 1), WLWH with a history of STIs and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their partners and other sexual partners and their",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

The authors evaluated the rapid antidepressant efficacy of ketamine in a large group of patients with treatment-resistant major depression. METHOD: This was a two-site, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial of a single infusion of ketamine compared to an active placebo control condition, the anesthetic midazolam. Patients with treatment-resistant major depression experiencing a major depressive episode were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine or midazolam in a 2:1 ratio (N=73). The primary outcome was change in depression severity 24 hours after drug administration, as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: The ketamine group had greater improvement in the MADRS score than the midazolam group 24 hours after treatment. After adjustment for baseline scores and site, the MADRS score was lower in the ketamine group than in the midazolam group by 7.95 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.20 to 12.71). The likelihood of response at 24 hours was greater with ketamine than with midazolam (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.21 to 4.14), with response rates of 64% and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in an optimized study design, further supporting NMDA receptor modulation as a novel mechanism for accelerated improvement in severe and chronic forms of depression.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain in patients with chronic pain.^\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the perception of pain in patients with chronic pain. METHOD: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in 20 patients with chronic pain. The patients received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) intravenously. The pain intensity was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the administration of the drug. RESULTS: The VAS scores were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the administration of the drug (p < 0.05). The MPQ scores were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the administration of the drug (p < 0.05).

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) on the neural correlates of emotional processing in 20 healthy volunteers. Participants were scanned twice, once after receiving ketamine and once after receiving placebo, in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. RESULTS: Ketamine increased the neural response to negative stimuli in the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and decreased the neural response to positive stimuli in the ventral striatum. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may exert its antidepressant effects by modulating the neural response to emotional stimuli.

Methods: All the subjects were preliminarily submitted to DSM-IV interviews and Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI). During a laboratory task, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), subjects earned monetary reinforcers with repeated button presses, and were provoked by the subtraction of money that was attributed to a fictitious other participant.

Results: Money-earning responses were not different in Ecstasy users and controls; aggressive responses were significantly higher in Ecstasy users in comparison with control subjects (F=20.74, P<.001). Baseline adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) levels were higher in Ecstasy users than in controls. No difference was found in norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) basal levels of the two groups.

7035,"A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Guided Dashboard to Review Psilocybin Target Domains: A Systematic Review.^\nBACKGROUND: Preliminary results from randomized controlled studies as well as identified molecular, cellular, and circuit targets of select psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) suggest that their effects are transdiagnostic. In this review, we exploit the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) transdiagnostic framework, to synthesize extant literature on psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the ""fear"" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the ""sustained threat"" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, ""perception and understanding of self,"" and ""social communications"" as well as enhancements in ""perception and understanding of others"" and ""affiliation and attachment"". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework. The combined effect of psilocybin with psychosocial interventions with RDoC-based outcomes is a priority therapeutic vista.","***TASK***

INPUT: A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Guided Dashboard to Review Psilocybin Target Domains: A Systematic Review.^\nBACKGROUND: Preliminary results from randomized controlled studies as well as identified molecular, cellular, and circuit targets of select psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) suggest that their effects are transdiagnostic. In this review, we exploit the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) transdiagnostic framework, to synthesize extant literature on psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains.

INPUT: The effect of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder. Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) is a novel treatment for MDD that has shown promising results in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the efficacy of PAT for MDD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PAT for MDD. We extracted data on study characteristics, patient characteristics, and outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We performed a meta-analysis of the primary outcome, the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to the end of treatment. RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs (n = 233) in the systematic review. The risk of bias was low in 3 RCTs and unclear in 9 RCTs. The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in the MADRS score from baseline to the end of treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.77 to -0.73, P <.001). The effect size was similar in the 3 RCTs with low risk of bias (SMD = -1.25, 95% CI = -1.77 to -0.73, P <.001). The effect size was also similar in the 9 RCTs with unclear risk of bias (SMD = -1.25, 95% CI = -1.77 to -0.73, P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: PAT is a promising treatment for MDD. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of RCTs and the risk of bias. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of PAT for MDD.

382,"Spectral Changes of EEG Following a 6-Week Low-Dose Oral Ketamine Treatment in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder and Chronic Suicidality.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has considerable therapeutic potential in alleviating major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality. However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n = 25) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the auditory P300 event-related potential in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) is a neurophysiological measure of cognitive function that is sensitive to the effects of antidepressant medication. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the P300 ERP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded before and 40 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02) and decreased the latency of the P300 ERP (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have a beneficial effect on cognitive function.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0
4367,"Decreased cerebral cortical serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users: A positron emission tomography/[11C]DASB and structural brain imaging study.^\nAnimal data indicate that the recreational drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) can damage brain serotonin neurons. However, human neuroimaging measurements of serotonin transporter binding, a serotonin neuron marker, remain contradictory, especially regarding brain areas affected; and the possibility that structural brain differences might account for serotonin transporter binding changes has not been explored. We measured brain serotonin transporter binding using [11C] N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4- cyanophenylthio) benzylamine in 50 control subjects and in 49 chronic (mean 4 years) ecstasy users (typically one to two tablets bi-monthly) withdrawn from the drug (mean 45 days). A magnetic resonance image for positron emission tomography image co-registration and structural analyses was acquired. Hair toxicology confirmed group allocation but also indicated use of other psychoactive drugs in most users. Serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users was significantly decreased throughout all cerebral cortices (range-19 to-46) and hippocampus (-21) and related to the extent of drug use (years, maximum dose), but was normal in basal ganglia and midbrain. Substantial overlap was observed between control and user values except for insular cortex, in which 51 of ecstasy user values fell below the lower limit of the control range. Voxel-based analyses confirmed a caudorostral gradient of cortical serotonin transporter binding loss with occipital cortex most severely affected. Magnetic resonance image measurement revealed no overall regional volume differences between groups; however, a slight left-hemispheric biased cortical thinning was detected in methamphetamine-using ecstasy users. The serotonin transporter binding loss was not related to structural changes or partial volume effect, use of other stimulant drugs, blood testosterone or oestradiol levels, major serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms, gender, psychiatric status, or self-reported hyperthermia or tolerance. The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions. © The Author (2010).","***TASK***

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and autonomic effects of psilocybin in humans.^\nPsilocybin is a classic hallucinogen that is structurally related to the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin. The effects of psilocybin are mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor, and the subjective effects of psilocybin are attenuated by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. The effects of psilocybin are also attenuated by the 5-HT2A agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). The present study was designed to determine whether the effects of psilocybin are attenuated by pretreatment with 5-MeO-DMT. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before receiving psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). The effects of psilocybin were assessed using a battery of subjective and autonomic measures. Pretreatment with 5-MeO-DMT attenuated the subjective effects of psilocybin, but did not attenuate the autonomic effects of psilocybin. These results suggest that the subjective effects of psilocybin are mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor. The lack of attenuation of the autonomic effects of psilocybin by 5-MeO-DMT suggests that the autonomic effects of psilocybin are mediated by a receptor other than the 5-HT2A receptor. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective experience of time.^\nRATIONALE: The subjective experience of time is a fundamental aspect of human consciousness. The psychedelic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist that has been shown to produce profound alterations in the subjective experience of time. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time. METHODS: A total of 20 healthy participants were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The subjective experience of time was assessed using the Temporal Experience of Pleasure and Affect Scale (TEPAS) and the Temporal Experience of Self-Awareness Scale (TESA). RESULTS: The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective experience of time dilation, as measured by the TEPAS. The TESA results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective experience of time compression. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that 5-MeO-DMT has a significant effect on the subjective experience of time. The findings of this study provide further evidence that 5-MeO-DMT is a potent psychedelic drug that can produce profound alterations in the subjective experience of time.

However, there are only a few data with controversial results in the paediatric population. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the use of low doses of intravenous ketamine on postoperative pain in children after surgery on the lower part of the body. METHODS: Thirty-seven children with ASA 1 or 2 from 6 to 60 months of age, undergoing scheduled surgery, were prospectively enrolled in a double blind sequential trial using a triangular test, with analysis every 10 patients treated. The children were randomly assigned to intravenously receive saline or 0.15 mg kg(-1) ketamine before surgery, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.4 microg kg(-1) min(-1) over 24 h. After sevoflurane induction and tracheal intubation, a caudal anaesthesia was performed in all children (1 ml kg(-1) of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine). The postoperative analgesic technique was standardized with intravenous paracetamol 15 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), rectal morniflumate (20 mg kg(-1) 12 h(-1)) and intravenous nalbuphine infusion 1.2 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1) for 24 h. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores, additional bolus of nalbuphine (if CHEOPS >7) and side effects were recorded from eye opening every 2 h over 24 h. The primary endpoint was the CHEOPS area under the curve. RESULTS: There was no difference in terms of additional bolus of nalbuphine as well as CHEOPS score area under the curve between groups, that is, 76 +/- 10 in the ketamine group versus 74 +/- 7 in the control group.

933,"Resting-state Network-specific Breakdown of Functional Connectivity during Ketamine Alteration of Consciousness in Volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Consciousness-altering anesthetic agents disturb connectivity between brain regions composing the resting-state consciousness networks (RSNs). The default mode network (DMn), executive control network, salience network (SALn), auditory network, sensorimotor network (SMn), and visual network sustain mentation. Ketamine modifies consciousness differently from other agents, producing psychedelic dreaming and no apparent interaction with the environment. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore ketamine-induced changes in RSNs connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers received stepwise intravenous infusions of ketamine up to loss of responsiveness. Because of agitation, data from six subjects were excluded from analysis. RSNs connectivity was compared between absence of ketamine (wake state [W1]), light ketamine sedation, and ketamine-induced unresponsiveness (deep sedation [S2]). RESULTS: Increasing the depth of ketamine sedation from W1 to S2 altered DMn and SALn connectivity and suppressed the anticorrelated activity between DMn and other brain regions. During S2, DMn connectivity, particularly between the medial prefrontal cortex and the remaining network (effect size β [95% CI]: W1 = 0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]; S2 = 0.07 [0.04 to 0.09]), and DMn anticorrelated activity (e.g., right sensory cortex: W1 = -0.07 [-0.09 to -0.04]; S2 = 0.04 [0.01 to 0.06]) were broken down.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the perception of pain in patients with chronic pain. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients with chronic pain were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in the visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain from baseline to 30 minutes after the administration of the study drug. The secondary outcomes were the changes in the VAS score for pain from baseline to 60 minutes and 120 minutes after the administration of the study drug, the changes in the VAS score for pain from baseline to 30 minutes after the administration of the study drug in the subgroup of patients with neuropathic pain, and the changes in the VAS score for pain from baseline to 30 minutes after the administration of the study drug in the subgroup of patients with nonneuropathic pain. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study.

4506,"LSD Increases Primary Process Thinking via Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^\nRationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.","***TASK***

INPUT: LSD Increases Primary Process Thinking via Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^\nRationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective experience of time.^\nBACKGROUND: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine that has been used in shamanic rituals for centuries. It is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and has been shown to produce a range of subjective effects, including altered perception of time. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time. METHODS: A total of 20 participants were recruited to take part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants were administered either 5-MeO-DMT (10 mg) or placebo and completed a battery of questionnaires assessing their subjective experience of time. RESULTS: Participants reported a significant increase in the subjective experience of time dilation following 5-MeO-DMT administration compared to placebo. This effect was most pronounced in the first 30 min following drug administration. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may have a unique effect on the subjective experience of time, which may be related to its potent agonist activity at the 5-HT2A receptor. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect and its potential therapeutic implications.

Oral racemic ketamine may be an important approach to the emergency management of suicide risk in clinical settings, especially in third world countries, that have a limited range of available healthcare resources. METHODS: In a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label investigation, we studied 30 severely depressed inpatients who consented to participate in a pilot hospital service offering ketamine for management of high suicide risk. Patients sipped a solution of racemic ketamine (150 mg) across 10-15 min in 3 alternate day sessions. Patients were assessed using the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Clinical Global Improvement-Severity (CGI-S) scale at baseline and 1 day after the last ketamine session. RESULTS: There was statistically and clinically significant improvement on all outcomes. Mean (standard deviation) MSSI scores dropped from 25.1(1.8) to 17.3(5.6), MADRS scores from 28.8(3.4) to 21.9(3.6), and CGI-S scores from 6.0(0.2) to 3.6(0.9). At endpoint, MSSI scores had dropped from severe to low or mild-to-moderate in 67% of patients. The 90 ketamine sessions were uneventful; the treatment was well tolerated and no patient dropped out.

Various studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship of LSD in healthy participants, but data on urinary recovery and confirmatory studies are missing. Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 μg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0–8, 8–16 and 16–24 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration–subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng/mL (1.6–2.0) and 3.4 ng/mL (3.0–3.8) after the administration of 85 and 170 μg LSD, respectively. Maximal concentrations were achieved on average after 1.7 h. Elimination half-lives were 3.7 h (3.4–4.1) and 4.0 h (3.6–4.4), for 85 and 170 μg LSD, respectively. Only 1% of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h, 16% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Urinary recovery was dose proportional. Mean (±standard deviation) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 ± 3.2 and 11 ± 3.7 h, and maximal effects (any drug effects) were 77 ± 18% and 87 ± 13% after 85 and 170 μg of LSD, respectively.

INPUT: Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and urinary recovery of oral lysergic acid diethylamide administration in healthy participants.^\nAims: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is currently investigated for several neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Various studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship of LSD in healthy participants, but data on urinary recovery and confirmatory studies are missing. Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 μg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0–8, 8–16 and 16–24 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration–subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) on the subjective and autonomic effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers.^\nAims: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic tryptamine that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It is also used recreationally, and its use is increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the subjective and autonomic effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers after pretreatment with 5-MeO-DMT. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received 5-MeO-DMT (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo 1 h before MDMA (75 mg). Subjective effects were measured using the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) and the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ). Autonomic effects were measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance. Results: 5-MeO-DMT pretreatment significantly reduced the subjective effects of MDMA on the 5D-ASC scales 'oceanic boundlessness' and 'dissociation' and on the DEQ scales'stimulation' and 'emotional arousal'. 5-MeO-DMT pretreatment also significantly reduced the autonomic effects of MDMA on the HRV scales 'total power' and 'high frequency' and on the skin conductance scale 'total power'. Conclusion: Pretreatment with 5-MeO-DMT significantly reduced the subjective and autonomic effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers. This suggests that 5-MeO-DMT may be a useful adjunct to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effect of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. We also investigated the relationship between the neural effects of ketamine and its subjective effects. RESULTS: Ketamine increased activity in the amygdala and insula during the processing of negative stimuli, and decreased activity in the amygdala and insula during the processing of positive stimuli. Ketamine also increased activity in the ventral striatum during the processing of positive stimuli. The subjective effects of ketamine were positively correlated with the neural effects of ketamine in the amygdala and insula. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that ketamine may have rapid antidepressant effects by modulating the neural correlates of emotional processing.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,0

It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset.

9174,"Cognitive behavior therapy to prevent relapse following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Ketamine has been shown to be a rapid and robust antidepressant, though effects of a single treatment are shortlived. Repeated infusions may prolong the effect somewhat, but worrisome cognitive effects of repeated exposure in rodents and substance abusers give pause to indefinite treatment. Thus, there is a great need to identify alternative augmentation/maintenance strategies capable of sustaining the ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects. The proposed study explores the feasibility and potential efficacy of combining ketamine and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to sustain this antidepressant response. Methods: Fifteen subjects with Major Depressive Episode will be recruited to undergo a brief course of 4 intravenous infusions of ketamine, given twice weekly for two weeks in combination with 12 sessions of CBT. Efficacy will be assessed using measures of sustained response (>50% decrease in Montgomery‐Asberg Depressive Rating Scale) for 8 weeks following the last infusion. Results: To date, 8 subjects have enrolled and initiated or completed the protocol. Half (4/8) have a history of electroconvulsive therapy and most (5/8, 63%) have a history of hospitalization.

METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded at baseline and 40 minutes after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP compared to placebo (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have cognitive enhancing effects in healthy volunteers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ketamine on the P300 ERP in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Twenty patients with treatment-resistant depression were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The P300 ERP was recorded at baseline and 40 minutes after drug administration. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the amplitude of the P300 ERP compared to placebo (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ketamine may have cognitive enhancing effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of ketamine on the P300 ERP in patients with depression.

7002,"Sleep Quality Improvements After MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^\nSleep disturbances (SDs) are among the most distressing and commonly reported symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite increased attention on sleep in clinical PTSD research, SDs remain difficult to treat. In Phase 2 trials, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy has been shown to greatly improve PTSD symptoms. We hypothesized that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy would improve self-reported sleep quality (SQ) in individuals with PTSD and be associated with declining PTSD symptoms. Participants in four studies (n = 63) were randomized to receive 2-3 sessions of active MDMA (75-125 mg; n = 47) or placebo/control MDMA (0-40 mg, n = 16) during all-day psychotherapy sessions. The PSQI was used to assess change in SQ from baseline to the primary endpoint, 1-2 months after the blinded sessions. Additionally, PSQI scores were measured at treatment exit (TE) and 12-month follow-up. Symptoms of PTSD were measured using the CAPS-IV. At the primary endpoint, CAPS-IV total severity scores dropped more after active MDMA than after placebo/control (-34.0 vs. -12.4), p = .003. Participants in the active dose group showed more improvement in SQ compared to those in the control group (PSQI total score ΔM = -3.5 vs. 0.6), p = .003. Compared to baseline, SQ had improved at TE, p < .001, with further significant gains reported at 12-month follow-up (TE to 12-months ΔM = -1.0), p = .030.

The psychedelic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist that has been shown to induce profound alterations in the subjective experience of time. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time. A total of 20 healthy participants were recruited for this study. Participants were administered a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT (25 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The subjective experience of time was assessed using the Temporal Experience of Self Scale (TESS) and the Temporal Experience Questionnaire (TEQ). The TESS and TEQ were administered at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-dose. The results showed that 5-MeO-DMT significantly increased the subjective experience of time, as measured by the TESS and TEQ. The effects of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time were most pronounced at 60 min post-dose. These findings suggest that 5-MeO-DMT may have a significant impact on the subjective experience of time. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of 5-MeO-DMT on the subjective experience of time.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in the average pain intensity score on a 0- to 10-point scale from baseline to 1 hour after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included the change in the average pain intensity score from baseline to 24 hours after the intervention, the change in the average pain intensity score from baseline to 1 hour after the intervention in patients with neuropathic pain, and the change in the average pain intensity score from baseline to 1 hour after the intervention in patients with nonneuropathic pain. RESULTS: The average pain intensity score decreased from baseline to 1 hour after the intervention in both the ketamine group (mean difference, -1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.6 to -1.0) and the placebo group (mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -2.1 to -0.5). The difference in the average pain intensity score between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (mean difference, -0.5; 95% CI, -1.5 to 0.5). The average pain intensity score decreased from baseline to 24 hours after the intervention in both the ketamine group (mean difference, -1.8; 95% CI, -2.6 to -1.0) and the placebo group (mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -2.1 to -0.5). The difference in the average pain intensity score between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (mean difference, -0.5; 95% CI, -1.5 to 0.5). The average pain intensity score decreased from baseline to 1 hour after the intervention in patients with neuropathic pain in both the ketamine group (mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.0) and the placebo group (mean difference, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.5 to -0.5). The difference in the average pain intensity score between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (mean difference, -0.5; 95% CI, -1.5 to 0.5).

5276,"Naltrexone but Not Ketanserin Antagonizes the Subjective, Cardiovascular, and Neuroendocrine Effects of Salvinorin-A in Humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Salvinorin-A is a terpene found in the leaves of the plant Salvia divinorum. When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans. METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2 groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50mg orally. In group 2, participants received the treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, ketanserin+placebo, and ketanserin+salvinorin-A. Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of 40mg orally. RESULTS: Inhalation of 1mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.","***TASK***

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover study. Twenty-four HIV-infected patients were randomized to receive either citalopram 5 mg or placebo on day 1. On day 2, all patients received a single dose of efavirenz 600 mg, lopinavir 400 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg. Blood samples were collected for 24 hours after drug administration. RESULTS: The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of efavirenz was 1.3-fold higher after citalopram administration than after placebo administration (P =.02). The mean AUC of lopinavir was 1.2-fold higher after citalopram administration than after placebo administration (P =.02). The mean AUC of ritonavir was 1.2-fold higher after citalopram administration than after placebo administration (P =.02). The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of efavirenz was 1.3-fold higher after citalopram administration than after placebo administration (P =.02). The mean Cmax of lopinavir was 1.2-fold higher after citalopram administration than after placebo administration (P =.02). The mean Cmax of ritonavir was 1.2-fold higher after citalopram administration than after placebo administration (P =.02). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 5 mg of citalopram increased the AUC and Cmax of efavirenz, lopinavir, and ritonavir. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

7750,"The NMDA antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT agonist psilocybin produce dissociable effects on structural encoding of emotional face expressions.^\nRATIONALE: Both glutamate and serotonin (5-HT) play a key role in the pathophysiology of emotional biases. Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases.","***TASK***

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure rCBF in 10 healthy volunteers before and after a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg). RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a significant increase in rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and lateral parietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that psilocybin produces a pattern of rCBF changes similar to that seen in the resting state, and that the 5-HT2A receptor may be involved in the regulation of resting state activity.

7073,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit suicdal cognition: a randomized controlled trial in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Preliminary evidence suggests intravenous (IV) ketamine has rapid effects on suicidal cognition, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine to use a psychoactive control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition as well as on a performancebased index of implicit suicidal cognition (the Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. Methods: Symptomatic patients with treatment‐resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to ≥ 3 antidepressants, were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Suicide Scale, Montgomery‐Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms‐Self Report suicide item) and the IAT to assess implicit suicidal associations. Measures were taken at baseline and 24‐hours following a single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine (n=37) or a psychoactive control with no known antidepressant properties (midazolam; n=21). Results: 24‐hours post‐infusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group (group x time: p=.01). 51% of ketamine‐treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24‐hours, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (Pearson's chi‐square p=.04). Implicit associations between self‐ and escape‐related words were also reduced following ketamine (p=.002; d=.51) but not midazolam (p=.65; d=.13). Conclusions: Intravenous ketamine produces rapid reductions in suicidal cognition over and above active placebo. Further study is warranted to explore whether ketamine's anti‐suicidal properties extend to higher‐risk samples and suicidal behaviors.","***TASK***

The task is to classify the sex of the participants studies based on the title and abstract of a research paper. If pregnant women are the study participants, select 'Both sexes' if > 5 pregnant women. In case a systematic review specifies the sex of included subjects and/or the number > 5, select the respective option.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 5 Sex of Participants options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Both sexes: We assume both sexes if nothing reported and ≥ 5 included subjects.

Female: 

Male: 

Not applicable: e.g., for most systematic reviews

Unknown: Neither the number of participants nor their sex is reported.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Both sexes, Female, Male, Not applicable, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that a single option can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: The effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression: a randomised controlled trial.^\nBackground: Suicidal ideation is a common symptom of depression and a major risk factor for suicide. We aimed to assess the effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, USA. We enrolled patients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression (defined as inadequate response to ≥2 antidepressants). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0·5 mg/kg) or placebo (0·9% saline) over 40 min. The primary outcome was change in suicidal ideation from baseline to 24 h after treatment, assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) item 10. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01035138. Findings: Between Jan 7, 2009, and Dec 31, 2012, we enrolled 68 patients, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to receive ketamine and 34 to receive placebo. At 24 h, the mean change in MADRS item 10 score was -1·1 (SD 1·4) in the ketamine group and -0·2 (1·2) in the placebo group (mean difference -0·9, 95% CI -1·6 to -0·2; p=0·01). The proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS item 10 score was 38% (13 of 34) in the ketamine group and 12% (four of 34) in the placebo group (odds ratio 4·5, 95% CI 1·2-16·9; p=0·02). The proportion of patients with a 100% or greater reduction in MADRS item 10 score was 21% (seven of 34) in the ketamine group and 3% (one of 34) in the placebo group (odds ratio 8·5, 95% CI 1·0-71·0; p=0·04). The proportion of patients with a 100% or greater reduction in MADRS item 10 score was 21% (seven of 34) in the ketamine group and 3% (one of 34) in the placebo group (odds ratio 8·5, 95% CI 1·0-71·0; p=0·04). Interpretation: A single dose of intravenous ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further study is warranted to explore whether ketamine's anti-suicidal properties extend to higher-risk samples and suicidal behaviours.
