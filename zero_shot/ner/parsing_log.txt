  Removed entity: 'Alcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability-adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short-term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best-studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well-designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double-blind, active placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow-up. Additionally, other alcohol associated parameters and associated common comorbidities as well as potential predictors and mediators for treatment response will be assessed.' (type: application-area)

The group change from baseline to the one-year follow up was significant and in the anticipated direction for alcohol and drug use severity, depression and anxiety, and some dimensions of quality of life. There was considerable individual variation in outcomes and treatment duration. The majority of participants rated all aspects of the program as important, including the spiritual and therapeutic significance of the ayahuasca experience which was rated as very significant. Based on the positive one-year outcomes, and within the limitations of an uncontrolled observational study design, the findings suggest promise for the effectiveness of the use of ayahuasca in a multifactorial treatment context for individuals with significant treatment histories, high levels of comorbidity and treatment motivation. Results highlight considerable variation in individual experience that merit in-depth qualitative analysis.

  Removed entity: 'Alcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability-adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short-term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best-studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well-designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double-blind, active placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow-up. Additionally, other alcohol associated parameters and associated common comorbidities as well as potential predictors and mediators for treatment response will be assessed.' (type: application-area)

Outcome measures included the Addiction Severity Index (V. 5), the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories, the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-SRPB. Likert rating scales were used to assess perceived importance and significance of different aspects of the program and overall participant satisfaction. The group change from baseline to the one-year follow up was significant and in the anticipated direction for alcohol and drug use severity, depression and anxiety, and some dimensions of quality of life. There was considerable individual variation in outcomes and treatment duration. The majority of participants rated all aspects of the program as important, including the spiritual and therapeutic significance of the ayahuasca experience which was rated as very significant. Based on the positive one-year outcomes, and within the limitations of an uncontrolled observational study design, the findings suggest promise for the effectiveness of the use of ayahuasca in a multifactorial treatment context for individuals with significant treatment histories, high levels of comorbidity and treatment motivation. Results highlight considerable variation in individual experience that merit in-depth qualitative analysis. Implications for ayahuasca-assisted and other psychedelic-assisted treatment alternatives are discussed.' (type: dosage)
