However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

3537,"Gray matter volume of rostral anterior cingulate cortex predicts rapid antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nKetamine was recently approved for treatment resistant depression. However, despite its therapeutic potential, about 50% of patients do not show improvement under this therapy. In this prospective two-site study, we investigated baseline brain structural predictors for rapid symptom improvement after a single subanesthetic ketamine infusion. Furthermore, given the preclinical evidence and findings from a pilot study in a clinical population that ketamine induces rapid neuroplasticity, we performed an exploratory investigation of macroscopic changes 24 h post-treatment. T1-weighted MRI brain images from 33 depressed patients were acquired before and 24 h after a single ketamine infusion and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Additionally, we performed a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of structures that have previously been shown to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine: bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that greater baseline volume of the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) significantly predicts rapid symptom reduction. The right ACC showed the same association in the ROI analysis, while the other regions yielded no significant results. Exploratory follow-up analyses revealed no volumetric changes 24 h after treatment. This is the first study reporting an association between pretreatment gray matter volume of the bilateral rACC and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. Results are in line with previous investigations, which highlighted the potential of the rACC as a biomarker for response prediction to different antidepressant treatments.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. The study was conducted at a research facility in the United States. The participants were 12 healthy volunteers who were between the ages of 21 and 45. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of psilocybin or a placebo. The dose of psilocybin was 0.3 mg/kg. The participants were monitored for 8 hours after receiving the drug. The primary outcome measure was the change in the subjective experience of the participants. The secondary outcome measures were the changes in the physiological measures and the changes in the psychological measures. The results showed that the participants who received psilocybin had a significant increase in the subjective experience of the drug.

Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min.

382,"Spectral Changes of EEG Following a 6-Week Low-Dose Oral Ketamine Treatment in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder and Chronic Suicidality.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has considerable therapeutic potential in alleviating major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality. However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n = 25) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.","***TASK***

INPUT: Spectral Changes of EEG Following a 6-Week Low-Dose Oral Ketamine Treatment in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder and Chronic Suicidality.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has considerable therapeutic potential in alleviating major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality. However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n = 25) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.

INPUT: The effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of depression. The primary outcome was the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score. The secondary outcomes were the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score, and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs involving 1,008 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose ketamine was superior to placebo in reducing the HAMD score (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.13 to -0.49, P < 0.00001), the MADRS score (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.13 to -0.49, P < 0.00001), and the CGI-S score (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.13 to -0.49, P < 0.00001). The results also showed that low-dose ketamine was superior to placebo in improving the CGI-I score (odds ratio [OR] = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.70 to 4.17, P < 0.00001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the low-dose ketamine group and the placebo group (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.58, P = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine is effective and safe in the treatment of depression. However, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the high risk of bias of the included studies.

2117,"Ayahuasca improves emotion dysregulation in a community sample and in individuals with borderline-like traits.^\nBACKGROUND: Research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may improve mindfulness-related capacities (e.g., decentering, non-judging, and non-reacting) and emotion regulation. Previously, our group reported that ayahuasca could be a potential analogue of mindfulness practice. The main aim of the current study was to examine the effects of ayahuasca on emotional regulation and mindfulness-related capacities. Secondarily, we sought to explore the effects of ayahuasca on individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits. METHOD: This is an observational study of 45 volunteers who participated in an ayahuasca session. The volunteers completed various self-report instruments designed to measure emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)-Short Form and Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)) prior to and 24 h after the ayahuasca session. The volunteers were divided into two subgroups based on their score on the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD). Twelve participants were grouped into the BPD-like traits subgroup while the rest of them were included in the non-BPD-like subgroup. We performed within-subjects and between-group analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed significant improvements on the FFMQ subscales observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting and also significantly improved on decentering (EQ scale) and on the DERS subscales emotional non-acceptance, emotional interference, and lack of control. The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice). Based on these results, we believe that ayahuasca therapy could be of value in clinical populations, such as individuals with BPD, affected by emotion dysregulation.","***TASK***

In recent years, psilocybin has been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and addiction. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature on the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We conducted a systematic search of the literature using the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. We included studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (n = 26) investigated the effects of psilocybin on neuropsychological measures, while the remaining studies (n = 6) investigated the effects of psilocybin on neuroimaging measures. The results of the neuropsychological studies suggest that psilocybin can produce a range of effects on cognitive and emotional processing. The results of the neuroimaging studies suggest that psilocybin can produce a range of effects on brain activity and connectivity. Overall, the results of the current literature suggest that psilocybin can produce a range of effects on the brain. However, the results are mixed and further research is needed to better understand the effects of psilocybin on the brain.

We conducted a systematic search of the literature using the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. We included studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (n = 26) investigated the effects of psilocybin on neuropsychological measures, while the remaining studies (n = 6) investigated the effects of psilocybin on neuroimaging measures. The results of the neuropsychological studies suggest that psilocybin can produce a range of effects on cognitive and emotional processing. The results of the neuroimaging studies suggest that psilocybin can produce a range of effects on brain activity and connectivity. Overall, the results of the current literature suggest that psilocybin can produce a range of effects",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

7573,"Modulation of the functional connectome in major depressive disorder by ketamine therapy.^\nBackground: Subanesthetic ketamine infusion therapy can produce fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients with major depression. How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales. Of these patients, n = 48 and n = 51, completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine infusions. Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks. These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment. Furthermore, following serial ketamine infusions, significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05, corrected). Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment, whereas non-remitters showed the opposite pattern. Conclusion: Results support that ketamine treatment leads to neurofunctional plasticity between distinct neural networks that are shown as disrupted in MDD patients. Cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops that encompass the SN could be a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound that has been used in religious and shamanic rituals for thousands of years. It is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and has been shown to produce profound alterations in mood and perception. METHODS: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. The drug was administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a rapid onset of action, with peak effects occurring within 30 min. The drug produced a marked increase in mood, with a significant increase in ratings of ""good drug effect"" and ""altered state of consciousness"" and a significant decrease in ratings of ""bad drug effect.""

6357,"Riluzole likely lacks antidepressant efficacy in ketamine non-responders.^\nBackground: In our primary analysis of a four‐week riluzole extension trial after open‐label ketamine in treatment‐resistant major depressive disorder (TRD), there was no significant difference in depression scores between riluzole and placebo extension (Ibrahim et al., 2012). Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders, which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders (Mathew et al., 2010). However, as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD, and, although glutamatergic, its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine's, we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non‐responders. Methods: 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥22 at screening and the day of infusion) received a single open‐label subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes. 4‐6 hours post‐infusion, subjects were randomized double‐blind to either flexible‐dose (100‐200mg/day) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis, and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule (50mg/week to a minimum of 100mg/day) for intolerable side effects. The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure. Responders and non‐responders were defined as ≥50% and<50% improvement, respectively, from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes (last pre‐randomization time point). Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within‐subjects factor and drug as a between‐subjects factor. MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate. All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model. Results: At 230 minutes post‐infusion, 32 patients were non‐responders, and 16 non‐responders were randomized to each arm. There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics (including length of illness, length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials) between groups. The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [F(1,29)=0.62, p=.44] or time [F(27,231)=1.50, p=.058]. There was also no interaction between drug and time [F(27,231)=1.15, p=.29]. This small sample size, however, may leave the study underpowered to detect a small‐to‐medium effect. In non‐responders, riluzole's maximum effect was observed at day one (d=.39) but was lost by day six. Yet, at the end of protocol, sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition ‐ placebo: 8/16 (50%) drop‐outs; riluzole: 6/16 (38%) dropouts. There was no statistically significant difference in drop‐outs between groups (p=.72), and, with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea, the remaining drop‐outs were attributed to psychiatric indications, i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood, anxiety or suicidal ideation. At day 28, there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo (6%) and no responders randomized to riluzole (drop‐outs were counted as non‐responders). Conclusions: Although potentially underpowered to detect a small‐to‐moderate‐sized effect, riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders. There are several potential limitations, however, that may preclude broader generalization to other populations: our highly‐refractory cohort and insufficient trial duration.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the human brain: a systematic review of the functional magnetic resonance imaging literature.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anesthetic and analgesic for over 50 years. In recent years, ketamine has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine's antidepressant effects is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its effects on glutamate neurotransmission. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been used to investigate the effects of ketamine on brain function in healthy volunteers and patients with depression. The aim of this review was to systematically review the fMRI literature on the effects of ketamine on the human brain. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. The search was limited to studies published in English between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2017. The search identified 1,018 studies, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. The studies were grouped into three categories: (1) studies investigating the effects of ketamine on resting-state brain function, (2) studies investigating the effects of ketamine on task-related brain function, and (3) studies investigating the effects of ketamine on brain function in patients with depression. The results of the studies were heterogeneous, with some studies reporting increases in brain activity and others reporting decreases in brain activity. The results of the studies were also heterogeneous in terms of the brain regions that were affected by ketamine.

54,"Ketamine for depression: where do we go from here?.^\nSince publication of the first randomized controlled trial describing rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, several reports have confirmed the potential utility of this dissociative anesthetic medication for treatment of major depressive episodes, including those associated with bipolar disorder and resistant to other medications and electroconvulsive therapy. These reports have generated several questions with respect to who might respond to ketamine, how, and for how long. To start answering these questions. We used PubMed.gov and ClinicalTrials.gov to perform a systematic review of all available published data on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and of all recently completed, ongoing, and planned studies. To date, 163 patients, primarily with treatment-resistant depression, have participated in case studies, open-label investigations, or controlled trials. All controlled trials have used a within-subject, crossover design with an inactive placebo as the control. Ketamine administration has usually involved an anaesthesiologist infusing a single, subanesthetic, intravenous dose, and required hospitalization for at least 24 hours postinfusion. Response rates in the open-label investigations and controlled trials have ranged from 25% to 85% at 24 hours postinfusion and from 14% to 70% at 72 hours postinfusion. Although adverse effects have generally been mild, some patients have experienced brief changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate. Risk-benefit analyses support further research of ketamine for individuals with severe mood disorders. However, given the paucity of randomized controlled trials, lack of an active placebo, limited data on long-term outcomes, and potential risks, ketamine administration is not recommended outside of the hospital setting.","***TASK***

486,"Intraoperative ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium or pain after major surgery in older adults: an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious postoperative complication. Subanaesthetic ketamine is often administered intraoperatively for postoperative analgesia, and some evidence suggests that ketamine prevents delirium. The primary purpose of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. METHODS: The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments [PODCAST] study is a multicentre, international randomised trial that enrolled adults older than 60 years undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence we randomly assigned patients to one of three groups in blocks of 15 to receive placebo (normal saline), low-dose ketamine (0·5 mg/kg), or high dose ketamine (1·0 mg/kg) after induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision. Participants, clinicians, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Delirium was assessed twice daily in the first 3 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. We did analyses by intention-to-treat and assessed adverse events. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01690988. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2014, and June 26, 2016, 1360 patients were assessed, and 672 were randomly assigned, with 222 in the placebo group, 227 in the 0·5 mg/kg ketamine group, and 223 in the 1·0 mg/kg ketamine group. There was no difference in delirium incidence between patients in the combined ketamine groups and the placebo group (19·45% vs 19·82%, respectively; absolute difference 0·36%, 95% CI -6·07 to 7·38, p=0·92). There were more postoperative hallucinations (p=0·01) and nightmares (p=0·03) with increasing ketamine doses compared with placebo. Adverse events (cardiovascular, renal, infectious, gastrointestinal, and bleeding), whether viewed individually (p value for each >0·40) or collectively (36·9% in placebo, 39·6% in 0·5 mg/kg ketamine, and 40·8% in 1·0 mg/kg ketamine groups, p=0·69), did not differ significantly across groups.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in the treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four patients with chronic PTSD. INTERVENTION: Intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score. Secondary outcome measures included the CAPS subscales, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). The CAPS total score was significantly reduced in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group at 24 hours (p = 0.02) and 72 hours (p = 0.01). The ketamine group also had significantly greater reductions in the CAPS subscales of reexperiencing (p = 0.02), avoidance (p = 0.01), and hyperarousal (p = 0.01) at 24 hours. The ketamine group also had significantly greater reductions in the BDI (p = 0.01) and BAI (p = 0.01) at 24 hours. The ketamine group had a significantly greater reduction in the HAM-D at 24 hours (p = 0.01) and 72 hours (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous ketamine is an effective treatment for chronic PTSD. The effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms is rapid and sustained. Ketamine may be a useful treatment for patients with chronic PTSD who have not responded to other treatments.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
692,"Relationships between reduction in symptoms and restoration of function and wellbeing: Outcomes of the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS).^\nRecovery of functioning is integral to successful treatment outcomes in depressive illness. Optimal antidepressant treatment results in both symptomatic remission and functional recovery. Oral ketamine rapidly reduces suicidality and depression; however, reports of functional and wellbeing outcomes are lacking. This study examines participants' social and occupational functioning and wellbeing outcomes in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes. Results suggest that reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation may be necessary but not sufficient for full restoration of function and wellbeing in antisuicidal and antidepressant therapy, including clinical trials.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: A systematic review^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to summarise the current literature on the effects of psilocybin on the brain. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to articles published in English between 2000 and 2020. A total of 20 articles were included in the review. The majority of studies investigated the effects of psilocybin on brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the default mode network (DMN) and decrease activity in the salience network (SN). Psilocybin was also found to increase connectivity between the DMN and the SN. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be dose-dependent. Psilocybin was also found to increase activity in the amygdala and decrease activity in the hippocampus. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be state-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex and decrease activity in the striatum. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be task-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and decrease activity in the posterior cingulate cortex. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be time-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the thalamus and decrease activity in the cerebellum. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be region-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the temporal lobe and decrease activity in the occipital lobe. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be hemisphere-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the left hemisphere and decrease activity in the right hemisphere. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be sex-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in males and decrease activity in females. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be age-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in young adults and decrease activity in older adults. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be drug-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the presence of other drugs and decrease activity in the absence of other drugs. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be dose-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity at low doses and decrease activity at high doses. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be time-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the acute phase and decrease activity in the chronic phase. The effects of psilocybin on brain activity were found to be region-dependent. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the frontal lobe and decrease activity in the temporal lobe.

Its mechanism of action is apparently novel. There are no published prospective studies of drug use outcomes with ibogaine. OBJECTIVES: To study outcomes following opioid detoxification with ibogaine. METHODS: In this observational study, 30 subjects with DSM-IV Opioid Dependence (25 males, 5 females) received a mean total dose of 1,540 ± 920 mg ibogaine HCl. Subjects used oxycodone (n = 21; 70%) and/or heroin (n = 18; 60%) in respective amounts of 250 ± 180 mg/day and 1.3 ± 0.94 g/day, and averaged 3.1 ± 2.6 previous episodes of treatment for opioid dependence. Detoxification and follow-up outcomes at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were evaluated utilizing the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and Addiction Severity Index Composite (ASIC) scores, respectively. RESULTS: SOWS scores decreased from 31.0 ± 11.6 pretreatment to 14.0 ± 9.8 at 76.5 ± 30 hours posttreatment (t = 7.07, df = 26, p < 0.001).

INPUT: The effects of ibogaine on the discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects of cocaine in rats.^\nIbogaine is a naturally occurring indole alkaloid that has been reported to reduce cocaine self-administration in humans and rats. The present study examined the effects of ibogaine on the discriminative stimulus and reinforcing effects of cocaine in rats. Ibogaine (0.1-10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent generalization to the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine (10 mg/kg) in rats trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. Ibogaine also produced a dose-dependent decrease in the reinforcing effects of cocaine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) in rats trained to self-administer cocaine under a fixed-ratio 5 schedule of reinforcement. Ibogaine (10 mg/kg) also produced a dose-dependent decrease in the reinforcing effects of cocaine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) in rats trained to self-administer cocaine under a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement. These results suggest that ibogaine may reduce cocaine self-administration by decreasing the reinforcing effects of cocaine.^\n

METHOD: Twenty-eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic. Post-treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 (4-7 days after the final infusion). Patients were followed up for six months where possible, with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout. RESULTS: Eight (29%) patients responded of whom four remitted. Only three (11%) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion, but in all responders, the response had developed before the third infusion. The duration of response from the final infusion was variable (median 70, range 25-168 days).

The subjects were tested on 3 occasions, 1 week apart, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The subjects were given either psilocybin, LSD, or placebo in a randomized order. The subjects were tested on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) before and after drug administration.

In smaller doses it is reported anecdotally to have stimulant properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the influence of a single 20mg ibogaine dose on psychological variables reflecting subjective mood state and a range of cognitive functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 healthy male volunteers received single 20mg doses of ibogaine after 6 days pretreatment with double-blind paroxetine or placebo. We compared responses to a battery of psychometric tests and subjective mood ratings performed before and 2h after ibogaine dosing, and assessed relationships between changes in test scores and concentrations of active moiety (the sum of molar noribogaine and ibogaine concentrations). Psychological tests were chosen based on responsiveness to opioid and serotonergic ligands. RESULTS: Ibogaine had minimal influence on psychological tests and mood ratings. The ability to selectively ignore distracting spatial information showed some evidence of modulation; however because this effect was limited to the less challenging condition calls into question the reliability of this result.

3012,"Potential Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin: A Systematic Review.^\nPsilocybin is a plant alkaloid that is derived from precursors of tryptamine and is present in many different types of mushrooms. It has been utilized by indigenous peoples of Central and South America for centuries in a ceremonial setting to promote spiritual experiences. Indigenous societies have long employed psilocybin and other 5-HT 2A agonist classic psychedelics in their rites. They were a focus in psychiatry in the middle of the 20th century as both experimental medicines and tools for studying brain function. Due to the fact that traditional psychedelics were being used for purposes other than medical research and in connection with the burgeoning counterculture by the late 1960s and early 1970s, these scientific investigations fell out of favor. However, thanks to a number of encouraging studies that validated the earlier research, interest in traditional psychedelics has surged among scientists in the 21st century. In this review, we examine therapeutic studies on psilocybin, the traditional psychedelic that has received the lion's share of recent attention. According to three controlled studies, psilocybin may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychological discomfort for at least six months after a single acute treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Three months after two acute doses, individuals in a small, open-label study with treatment-resistant depression reported fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms. Small, open-label pilot studies on addiction have demonstrated encouraging success rates for alcohol and cigarette addiction. The review also briefly discusses the synthesis, mechanism of action, effects, molecular pharmacology, adverse effects, and contraindications of psilocybin.","***TASK***

INPUT: Potential Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin: A Systematic Review.^\nPsilocybin is a plant alkaloid that is derived from precursors of tryptamine and is present in many different types of mushrooms. It has been utilized by indigenous peoples of Central and South America for centuries in a ceremonial setting to promote spiritual experiences. Indigenous societies have long employed psilocybin and other 5-HT 2A agonist classic psychedelics in their rites. They were a focus in psychiatry in the middle of the 20th century as both experimental medicines and tools for studying brain function. Due to the fact that traditional psychedelics were being used for purposes other than medical research and in connection with the burgeoning counterculture by the late 1960s and early 1970s, these scientific investigations fell out of favor. However, thanks to a number of encouraging studies that validated the earlier research, interest in traditional psychedelics has surged among scientists in the 21st century. In this review, we examine therapeutic studies on psilocybin, the traditional psychedelic that has received the lion's share of recent attention. According to three controlled studies, psilocybin may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychological discomfort for at least six months after a single acute treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Three months after two acute doses, individuals in a small, open-label study with treatment-resistant depression reported fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms. Small, open-label pilot studies on addiction have demonstrated encouraging success rates for alcohol and cigarette addiction. The review also briefly discusses the synthesis, mechanism of action, effects, molecular pharmacology, adverse effects, and contraindications of psilocybin.

INPUT: The therapeutic potential of psilocybin: preclinical evidence and clinical trials.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits. Preclinical studies have shown that psilocybin can produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. Clinical trials have also demonstrated the efficacy of psilocybin in treating depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders. In this review, we discuss the preclinical evidence and clinical trials that support the therapeutic potential of psilocybin. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of current research and discuss future directions for psilocybin research.

4356,"MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers: a systematic review^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic substance that has been used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers are not well understood. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies that examined the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. We searched PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 2019. We included studies that examined the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. We excluded studies that examined the effects of psilocybin in patients with psychiatric disorders. We extracted data on study design, sample size, psilocybin dose, and outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the United States (n = 5), the United Kingdom (n = 4), the Netherlands (n = 2), and Canada (n = 1). The studies included a total of 172 healthy volunteers. The psilocybin dose ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg. The studies examined the effects of psilocybin on a variety of cognitive and mood outcomes. The most common cognitive outcome was working memory, which was assessed in 10 studies. The most common mood outcome was anxiety, which was assessed in 11 studies. The studies generally found that psilocybin had positive effects on cognition and mood. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin appears to have positive effects on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. However, the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers are not well understood. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers.

Twenty-three healthy subjects completed 4 test days involving the oral administration of lorazepam or matched placebo 2 h prior to the i.v. infusion of ketamine or placebo. Ketamine: 1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); 2) evoked perceptual alterations as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS); 3) impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and other tests sensitive to frontal cortical impairment; and 4) had amnestic effects. Lorazepam produced attention impairments, concrete proverb interpretations, and recall impairments. Lorazepam reduced ketamine-associated emotional distress and there was a non-significant trend for it to decrease perceptual alterations produced by ketamine. However, it failed to reduce many cognitive and behavioral effects of ketamine, including psychosis. Further, lorazepam exacerbated the sedative, attention-impairing, and amnestic effects of ketamine. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between these medications.

4632,"The novel psychoactive phenetylamine 4-fluoroamphetamine produces a mild psychedelic state without affecting creative thinking.^\nThe phenetylamine 4‐fluoroamphetamine (4‐FA) is a so‐called novel psychoactive substance with a chemical structure that resembles that of amphetamine and MDMA [1]. Since 4‐FA users report the subjective experience to range between that induced by amphetamine and MDMA, and it is known both substances can produce an altered state of consciousness, it will be tested whether 4‐FA induces a similar state. In addition, dissociative states have been linked with increased creativity or creative thinking [2]. In light of the renewed interest in psychedelics as therapeutic tools in the treatment of psychopathologies like depression and anxiety disorders, where rigid thinking is one of the hallmarks, it is important to test whether this new compound can induce flexible thinking. A placebo‐controlled 2‐way crossover study in twelve healthy poly‐drug users was conducted to test subjective and behavioral effects of 4‐FA (100 mg). The 100 mg dose was based on a user survey amongst Dutch 4‐FA users. The majority of the users who knew which dose they ingest typically indicated it to be between 50‐150 mg [1]. Subjective effects were tested by means of the Bowdle Visual Analogue Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale and the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale. Convergent and divergent thinking was assessed by means of the Picture Concept test (PCT). Both subjective and objective measures have previously been shown to be sensitive to the effects of stimulants and/or psychedelic substances [3,4]. Measurements took place 1‐to‐11 hours post‐administration. 4‐FA concentrations were determined in serum up to 12 hours after administration. Findings showed that 4‐FA induced a psychedelic state which was highest 1 hour after 4‐FA administration, around 4‐FA peak serum concentrations. The 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state decreased over time. There was no effect of 4‐FA on creative thinking. While the hypothesis that 4‐FA would induce a psychedelic state that can be categorized in between that produced by amphetamine and MDMA was confirmed, the hypothesized effect on divergent thinking could not be confirmed. Although not statistically significant, it was interesting to see that convergent thinking was increased 6 hours after intake compared to placebo, while divergent thinking performance was placebo‐like. This pattern is opposite to the previously demonstrated ayahuasca effect where two hours after intake convergent thinking was decreased by 15% compared to baseline and divergent thinking was increased by approximately 20% [4]. To confirm the absence or presence of 4‐FA effects on creative thinking, future research needs to include creative performance tests at different time points in the serum curve. In addition, creative thinking should then also be assessed in proximity with the peak of dissociative effects to test whether both are associated as suggested by previous studies linking dissociative states and creativity [3].

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of magnetic resonance imaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been investigated for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to systematically and critically evaluate the current literature on the effects of psilocybin on the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A systematic search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search was limited to studies published in English between 2000 and 2020. The search yielded 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The studies were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design, sample size, and outcome measures. The majority of the studies reported changes in brain activity and connectivity in regions associated with emotion, cognition, and perception. However, the findings were inconsistent across studies, and the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. The current literature on the effects of psilocybin on the brain using MRI is limited and heterogeneous. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of psilocybin on the brain and its potential therapeutic applications.

Two factors may have confounded results in abstinent users: memory task characteristics and polydrug use. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to assess whether a single dose of MDMA affects spatial memory performance during intoxication and withdrawal phase and whether spatial memory performance after MDMA is task dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design.

Two spatial memory tasks of varying complexity were used that required either storage of stimulus location alone (spatial memory task) or memory for location as well as processing of content or contextual information (change blindness task). RESULTS: After a single dose of MDMA, the subjects made larger localization errors and responded faster compared to placebo in the simple spatial memory task during intoxication phase. Inaccuracy was not due to increased response speed, as determined by regression analysis. Performance in the change blindness task was not affected by MDMA.

Through self-administration of psilocybin, these patients have achieved robust pain relief with decreased reliance on traditional analgesic medications. Despite varying preparations and uncertain potencies, the analgesic effects for all 3 patients occurred at doses without a psychedelic experience and with minimal cognitive or somatic adverse effects. Furthermore, the efficacy of pain relief and, in some cases, the duration of the effect were magnified when coupled with functional exercise.

We included studies that used neuropsychological tests or neuroimaging techniques to assess the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We excluded studies that did not report the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies (n = 26) used neuroimaging techniques to assess the effects of psilocybin on the brain. The most common neuroimaging technique was functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 18). The most common neuropsychological test was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (n = 6). The most common neuroimaging finding was increased activity in the default mode network (DMN) (n = 10). The most common neuropsychological finding was improved performance on the WCST (n = 4). The effects of psilocybin on the brain are complex and not fully understood. Further research is needed to better understand the",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"

This study evaluated the efficacy of twice- and thrice-weekly intravenous administration of ketamine in sustaining initial antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: In a multicenter, double-blind study, adults (ages 18-64 years) with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) or intravenous placebo, administered over 40 minutes, either two or three times weekly, for up to 4 weeks. Patients who discontinued double-blind treatment after at least 2 weeks for lack of efficacy could enter an optional 2-week open-label phase to receive ketamine with the same frequency as in the double-blind phase. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to day 15 in total score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: In total, 67 (45 women) of 68 randomized patients received treatment. In the twice-weekly dosing groups, the mean change in MADRS score at day 15 was -18.4 (SD=12.0) for ketamine and -5.7 (SD=10.2) for placebo; in the thrice-weekly groups, it was -17.7 (SD=7.3) for ketamine and -3.1 (SD=5.7) for placebo. Similar observations were noted for ketamine during the open-label phase (twice-weekly, -12.2 [SD=12.8] on day 4; thrice-weekly, -14.0 [SD=12.5] on day 5). Both regimens were generally well tolerated. Headache, anxiety, dissociation, nausea, and dizziness were the most common (≥20%) treatment-emergent adverse events. Dissociative symptoms occurred transiently and attenuated with repeated dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Twice-weekly and thrice-weekly administration of ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg similarly maintained antidepressant efficacy over 15 days.","***TASK***

INPUT: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Frequency Study of Intravenous Ketamine in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated a rapid-onset antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression. This study evaluated the efficacy of twice- and thrice-weekly intravenous administration of ketamine in sustaining initial antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: In a multicenter, double-blind study, adults (ages 18-64 years) with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) or intravenous placebo, administered over 40 minutes, either two or three times weekly, for up to 4 weeks. Patients who discontinued double-blind treatment after at least 2 weeks for lack of efficacy could enter an optional 2-week open-label phase to receive ketamine with the same frequency as in the double-blind phase. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to day 15 in total score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: In total, 67 (45 women) of 68 randomized patients received treatment. In the twice-weekly dosing groups, the mean change in MADRS score at day 15 was -18.4 (SD=12.0) for ketamine and -5.7 (SD=10.2) for placebo; in the thrice-weekly groups, it was -17.7 (SD=7.3) for ketamine and -3.1 (SD=5.7) for placebo. Similar observations were noted for ketamine during the open-label phase (twice-weekly, -12.2 [SD=12.8] on day 4; thrice-weekly, -14.0 [SD=12.5] on day 5). Both regimens were generally well tolerated. Headache, anxiety, dissociation, nausea, and dizziness were the most common (≥20%) treatment-emergent adverse events. Dissociative symptoms occurred transiently and attenuated with repeated dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Twice-weekly and thrice-weekly administration of ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg similarly maintained antidepressant efficacy over 15 days.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin, a classic psychedelic, has shown promise as a treatment for depression. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at six sites in the UK and the USA. We enrolled adults with treatment-resistant depression (defined as a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score of 22 or more and a score of 4 or more on item 10 [suicidal thoughts] of the MADRS, and a score of 4 or more on item 9 [loss of interest] of the MADRS, despite treatment with at least two antidepressants in the current episode, or a score of 4 or more on item 9 of the MADRS despite treatment with at least one antidepressant in the current episode and at least two antidepressants in the past). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive psilocybin (0·3 mg/kg) or placebo in two sessions, 1 week apart. The primary outcome was the change in MADRS score from baseline to week 3. We used a mixed-effects model for repeated measures to analyse the primary outcome. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01882534. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016, we randomly assigned 59 participants to receive psilocybin (n=30) or placebo (n=29). The mean change in MADRS score from baseline to week 3 was -11·9 (SD 6·0) in the psilocybin group and -6·5 (6·2) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference -5·7, 95% CI -9·1 to -2·3; p=0·001). The mean change in MADRS score from baseline to week 1 was -5·1 (6·0) in the psilocybin group and -1·1 (5·6) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference -3·9, 95% CI -7·4 to -0·4; p=0·028). The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin was associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The safety profile was acceptable.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study of intravenous ketamine as adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal dose of intravenous ketamine for adjunctive treatment of treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adults with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.5 mg/kg of body weight) or intravenous placebo, administered over 40 minutes, once daily for 4 days. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to day 4 in total score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: In total, 68 (45 women) of 70 randomized patients received treatment. The mean change in MADRS score at day 4 was -11.1 (SD=10.0) for ketamine and -1.9 (SD=7.7) for placebo. The mean change in MADRS score at day 4 was -12.0 (SD=10.0) for the 0.2-mg/kg dose, -11.0 (SD=10.0) for the 0.4-mg/kg dose, and -11.1 (SD=10.0) for the 0.5-mg/kg dose. The 0.2-mg/kg dose was associated with a significantly greater reduction in MADRS score than placebo (p=0.001). The most common (≥20%) treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, anxiety, dissociation, nausea, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive intravenous ketamine at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg was associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The safety profile was acceptable. FUNDING: Janssen Research & Development, LLC.

Here we correlated antidepressant response to ketamine with baseline neural response to emotional faces when judging emotion and gender. Methods: Ten unmedicated depressed MDD patients(3 males) participated in an FMRI study. Identical emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender. Subjects then participated in a placebo‐controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine(.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed repeatedly using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Multiple regression estimated BOLD response when judging emotion (positive/ negative) and when judging gender (positive/negative). BOLD response (4 conditions) was correlated with treatment outcome(percent change in MADRS). Significance defined as voxel p<0.005; whole brain corrected. Results: BOLD response correlated positively with treatment response when judging negative emotion bilaterally in middle occipital cortex(MOC) and in left parahippocampal gyrus; and correlated positively when judging positive emotion in an overlapping region of left MOC. When judging gender and emotion was positive, a positive correlation was observed in a more dorsal, non‐overlapping region of left MOC. Conclusions: Neural activity in bilateral MOC when judging negative emotion correlated with subsequent treatment response to ketamine, regions previously found to predict treatment response to another rapid antidepressant (scopolamine).

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the brain: a systematic review of the clinical and preclinical literature.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anesthetic and analgesic for over 50 years. In recent years, ketamine has been used as a treatment for depression, and has been shown to have rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. The mechanism of action of ketamine in depression is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the glutamatergic system. Ketamine has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, and has been used as a treatment for chronic pain. The effects of ketamine on the brain are not fully understood, but it is thought to have both acute and chronic effects. The acute effects of ketamine include sedation, analgesia, and amnesia. The chronic effects of ketamine include neurotoxicity, neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis. Ketamine has also been shown to have effects on the immune system, and has been used as a treatment for autoimmune diseases.

9277,"Low-dose ketamine does not improve the speed of recovery from depression in electroconvulsive therapy: a randomized controlled trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder. Recent literature has shown that the anesthetic agent ketamine has some antidepressant properties at low doses and may be an alternative therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. We hypothesized that the use of low-dose ketamine as an anesthetic adjunct in ECT would more rapidly improve depression while maintaining hemodynamic stability than ECT with propofol alone. METHODS: Institutional ethics approval was obtained, and the use of ketamine in this study was approved by Health Canada. This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that involved ketamine administration at 0.5 mg/kg IV in addition to propofol anesthesia for ECT. The primary outcome was the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 50% reduction in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes included the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 25% reduction in MADRS score, as well as any differences in the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity, hemodynamic variables, and seizure duration. Adverse events were recorded for safety assessment. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients completed the study. No difference was found between groups with respect to the primary or secondary outcomes. The ketamine group showed a trend towards a decreased dose of propofol required to achieve adequate anesthesia. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine does not improve psychiatric outcomes in the setting of propofol-based anesthesia for ECT. Specifically, ketamine did not reduce the number of ECT sessions necessary to achieve a 50 or 25% reduction in MADRS scores. Reassuringly, the fact that no differences in hemodynamic variables or unexpected adverse events occurred suggests that low-dose ketamine may be safely used in this setting should clinical indications warrant its use.

However, the optimal dose of ketamine for the treatment of depression remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the efficacy of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared low-dose ketamine with placebo in the treatment of depression. The primary outcome was the response rate, and the secondary outcomes were the remission rate and the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score. RESULTS: A total of 10 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose ketamine was superior to placebo in terms of the response rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-1.90, P < 0.001) and the remission rate (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.28-1.90, P < 0.001). The change in the HAMD score was also significantly greater in the low-dose ketamine group than in the placebo group (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.55, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.35, P < 0.001).

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic substance that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of psilocybin is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant that is thought to act by increasing the release of dopamine and noradrenaline. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg), and placebo. Sustained attention was assessed using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased the number of lapses of attention (P = 0.001) and decreased the mean reaction time (P = 0.001) compared with placebo. Methylphenidate significantly decreased the number of lapses of attention (P = 0.001) and increased the mean reaction time (P = 0.001) compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and methylphenidate have opposite effects on sustained attention. These findings suggest that the effects of psilocybin on sustained attention are mediated by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"

Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days.

698,"Ketanserin Reverses the Acute Response to LSD in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study in Healthy Participants.^\nBACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is currently being investigated in psychedelic-assisted therapy. LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8-11 hours. It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (HT2A) receptor. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD. However, unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD. METHODS: We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 24 healthy participants who underwent two 14-hour sessions and received ketanserin (40 mg p.o.) or placebo 1 hour after LSD (100 µg p.o.). Outcome measures included subjective effects, autonomic effects, acute adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD, thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5 hours with placebo to 3.5 hours. Ketanserin also reversed LSD-induced alterations of mind, including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution. Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5-HT2A receptors. Ketanserin can effectively be used as a planned or rescue option to shorten and attenuate the LSD experience in humans in research and LSD-assisted therapy.

791,"Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers: a systematic review.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies for thousands of years and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. The search was limited to studies published in English between 1960 and 2015. The search identified 1,015 articles, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and examined the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood. The studies were of variable quality and included a total of 156 participants. The studies were grouped into three categories: (1) studies that examined the effects of psilocybin on cognitive performance, (2) studies that examined the effects of psilocybin on mood, and (3) studies that examined the effects of psilocybin on both cognitive performance and mood. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies finding no effects of psilocybin on cognitive performance or mood, while others found significant effects. The studies that found significant effects of psilocybin on cognitive performance or mood generally used higher doses of psilocybin than the studies that found no effects. The results of this systematic review suggest that psilocybin has the potential to affect cognitive performance and mood in healthy volunteers. However, the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood are not consistent across studies and may be dependent on the dose of psilocybin used. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose of psilocybin for use in healthy volunteers.

The subjects were tested on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) before and after each drug administration. The results showed that psilocybin and LSD produced similar effects on mood and empathy. Both drugs produced a significant increase in the POMS scores for the factors of tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. The IRI scores for the factors of perspective taking and fantasy were significantly increased by both drugs.

However, whether ketamine-induced happiness can predict the treatment response of ketamine infusion among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unknown. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 71 adult patients with TRD (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute ketamine (0.5 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg) or normal saline placebo infusion. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Measurements were conducted prior to infusion, at 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion, and, sequentially, on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion. The visual analog scale for happiness (VASH) was used to assess happiness during infusion. The positive symptoms subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-P) was used to measure the potential psychotomimetic effects of ketamine. RESULTS: For both the 2-factor (ketamine vs placebo) and 3-factor (ketamine 0.5 mg/kg vs 0.2 mg/kg vs placebo) models, a generalized estimating equation model indicated that infusion response type (happiness vs nonhappiness) significantly (P = .008 vs P = .002) predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms after infusion. Changes in VASH and BPRS-P measures were not associated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion over time.

INPUT: The effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression are still unclear. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of low-dose ketamine with placebo in patients with depression. The primary outcome was the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score from baseline to the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to the end of treatment, the response rate, and the remission rate. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs with 1,008 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose ketamine was superior to placebo in reducing the HAMD score (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.92 to -0.38, P < 0.00001) and the MADRS score (SMD = -0.65, 95% CI = -0.92 to -0.38, P < 0.00001). The response rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.90, P < 0.0001) and the remission rate (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.90, P < 0.0001) were also significantly higher in the low-dose ketamine group than in the placebo group.

1554,"Disrupted 'reflection' impulsivity in cannabis users but not current or former ecstasy users.^\nEvidence for serotonin involvement in impulsivity has generated interest in the measurement of impulsivity in regular ecstasy users, who are thought to display serotonergic dysfunction. However, current findings are inconsistent. Here, we used a recently developed Information Sampling Test to measure 'reflection' impulsivity in 46 current ecstasy users, 14 subjects who used ecstasy in the past, 15 current cannabis users and 19 drug-naïve controls. Despite elevated scores on the Impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy questionnaire, the current and previous ecstasy users did not differ significantly from the drug-naive controls on the Information Sampling Test. In contrast, the cannabis users sampled significantly less information on the task, and tolerated a lower level of certainty in their decision-making, in comparison to the drug-naive controls.

INPUT: Disrupted 'reflection' impulsivity in cannabis users but not current or former ecstasy users.^\nEvidence for serotonin involvement in impulsivity has generated interest in the measurement of impulsivity in regular ecstasy users, who are thought to display serotonergic dysfunction. However, current findings are inconsistent. Here, we used a recently developed Information Sampling Test to measure 'reflection' impulsivity in 46 current ecstasy users, 14 subjects who used ecstasy in the past, 15 current cannabis users and 19 drug-naïve controls. Despite elevated scores on the Impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy questionnaire, the current and previous ecstasy users did not differ significantly from the drug-naive controls on the Information Sampling Test. In contrast, the cannabis users sampled significantly less information on the task, and tolerated a lower level of certainty in their decision-making, in comparison to the drug-naive controls. The effect in cannabis users extends our earlier observations in amphetamine- and opiate-dependent individuals (Clark, et al., 2006, Biological Psychiatry 60: 515-522), and suggests that reduced reflection may be a common cognitive style across regular users of a variety of substances.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic substance that has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of psilocybin is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the serotonin system. Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant that is thought to act on the dopamine system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg), and placebo. Sustained attention was assessed using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased the number of lapses of attention (P = 0.001) and decreased the mean reaction time (P = 0.001) compared with placebo. Methylphenidate significantly decreased the number of lapses of attention (P = 0.001) and increased the mean reaction time (P = 0.001) compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and methylphenidate have opposite effects on sustained attention. The effects of psilocybin are consistent with the known effects of serotonin on attention. The effects of methylphenidate are consistent with the known effects of dopamine on attention. These findings suggest that the effects of psilocybin on sustained attention are mediated by the serotonin system, and the effects of methylphenidate on sustained attention are mediated by the dopamine system.

Current treatments are lacking in effectiveness and adherence. Therefore, this study examined psychedelic treatment with ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine for trauma-related psychological and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. METHOD: We conducted a survey of Veterans who completed a specific psychedelic clinical program in Mexico between 2017 and 2019. Questions probed retrospective reports of mental health and cognitive functioning during the 30 days before and 30 days after treatment. A total of 65 people completed treatment during this time frame and were eligible for contact. Of these, 51 (78%) completed the survey and were included in data analyses (mean age = 40; male = 96%; married = 55%; Caucasian/White = 92%; Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Service = 96%). RESULTS: Results indicated significant and very large reductions in retrospective report of suicidal ideation (p < .001; d = -1.9), cognitive impairment (p < .001; d = -2.8), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .001; d = -3.6), depression (p < .001; d = -3.7), and anxiety (p < .001; d = -3.1). Results also showed a significant and large increase in retrospective report of psychological flexibility (p < .001; d = 2.9) from before-to-after the psychedelic treatment. Increases in the retrospective report of psychological flexibility were strongly associated with retrospective report of reductions in cognitive impairment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (rs range -0.61 to -0.75; p < .001). Additionally, most participants rated the psychedelic experiences as one of the top five personally meaningful (84%), spiritually significant (88%), and psychologically insightful (86%) experiences of their lives.Limitations: Several limitations should be considered including the retrospective, self-report, survey design of the study, and the lack of randomization and blinding, thus making these finding preliminary. CONCLUSION: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans may have unique treatment needs because of the sequela of problems associated with repeated trauma exposure and the nature of the exposure. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with these under-researched psychedelics may hold unique promise for this population.

INPUT: The therapeutic use of psilocybin in the treatment of end-of-life anxiety.^\nBACKGROUND: Anxiety is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer. The use of psilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, in the treatment of anxiety in patients with advanced cancer has been reported in a small number of case reports. OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients with advanced cancer who received psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety at the University of California, San Francisco, between 2004 and 2011. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients with advanced cancer were identified who received psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety. The mean age of the patients was 58 years (range, 40-75 years). The most common cancer diagnoses were breast (n = 4), lung (n = 3), and gastrointestinal (n = 2). The mean number of psilocybin sessions was 2.3 (range, 1-4). The mean time between the first and last psilocybin session was 3.5 months (range, 1-12 months). The mean time between the first and last follow-up visit was 7.5 months (range, 1-24 months). The mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety score decreased from 15.3 (range, 8-21) to 7.3 (range, 0-15) (P =.0001). The mean HADS depression score decreased from 8.3 (range, 0-16) to 4.3 (range, 0-11) (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin may be an effective treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced cancer.

These preliminary results support the effectiveness of The Illicit Project. Further follow-up is required to determine the durability of the results over time.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide on mood and anxiety of subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder.^\nPsilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are hallucinogenic drugs that have been used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The present study examined the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mood and anxiety in subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder. Subjects were 12 healthy volunteers with a history of psychiatric disorder. Subjects were administered psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), LSD (0.1 mg/kg), and placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Mood and anxiety were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Both psilocybin and LSD produced significant increases in the POMS total mood disturbance score, which was primarily due to increases in the POMS depression-dejection and anger-hostility subscales. Psilocybin and LSD also produced significant increases in the STAI state anxiety score. The results of the present study suggest that psilocybin and LSD produce increases in mood disturbance and anxiety in subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown that psilocybin and LSD produce increases in mood disturbance and anxiety in healthy volunteers. The present study extends these findings by showing that psilocybin and LSD produce increases in mood disturbance and anxiety in subjects with a history of psychiatric disorder.

1981,"Comparative effectiveness of esketamine in the treatment of anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Anhedonia is a symptom associated with poorer outcomes in depression treatment, including resistance to treatment, higher functional impact and suicidality. Few drugs are known to adequately treat anhedonia in both unipolar and bipolar depression. The NMDA antagonist ketamine has been demonstrated to be effective in rapidly ameliorating anhedonia in depressive episodes. The main aim of present study is to evaluate the anti-anhedonic effect of esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine recently approved for treatment-resistant depression, in unipolar and bipolar depression. METHODS: 70 patients with unipolar or bipolar depression were treated with 6 weekly subcutaneous esketamine infusions (0.5-1mg/kg). Anhedonia was measured through MADRS item 8 before and 24h after each infusion. RESULTS: A significant reduction in anhedonia severity was observed (p<0.0001) after 6 infusions. The effect was statistically significant 24h after the first infusion (p<0.001) in both unipolar and bipolar groups and increased with repeated infusions. Anti-anhedonic effect of esketamine did not differ between groups. LIMITATIONS: This is an open-label, real-world study. Lack of blinding and of a placebo arm may limit the interpretation of findings. CONCLUSION: Although preliminary, present findings suggest that repeated subcutaneous esketamine infusions are effective for the treatment of anhedonia in both unipolar and bipolar depressed patients.

During the reconsolidation window, memories are activated into a labile state and can be reconsolidated in an altered form. This concept might have significant clinical implications in treating PTSD. In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine, followed by brief exposure therapy, to enhance post-retrieval extinction of PTSD trauma memories. 27 individuals diagnosed with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg 40 min; N = 14) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg; N = 13) after retrieval of the traumatic memory. 24 h following infusion, participants received a four-day trauma-focused psychotherapy. Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up. Amygdala activation to trauma scripts (a major biomarker of fear response) served as the main study outcome. Although PTSD symptoms improved equally in both groups, post-treatment, ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala (-0.33, sd = 0.13, 95%HDI [-0.56,-0.04]) and hippocampus (-0.3 (sd = 0.19), 95%HDI [-0.65, 0.04]; marginal effect) reactivation to trauma memories, compared to midazolam recipients. Post-retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (-0.28, sd = 0.11, 95%HDI [-0.46, -0.11]), with no change in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Moreover, reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi-lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients (right: post-treatment: -0.01108, 95% HDI [-0.0184,-0.003]; follow-up: -0.0183, 95% HDI [-0.02719,-0.0107]; left: post-treatment: -0.019, 95% HDI [-0.028,-0.011]; follow-up: -0.017, 95% HDI [-0.026,-0.007]).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. The results showed that ketamine significantly reduced the intensity of the negative emotions expressed by the faces. In addition, ketamine significantly reduced the activation of the amygdala and the insula in response to negative emotions. These results suggest that ketamine may have a rapid effect on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.

However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning.

INPUT: Long-term outcomes of psychoactive drug use in trauma patients: A multicenter patient-reported outcomes study.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychoactive drug use (PDU) is reported in up to 40% of trauma patients and is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications. However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/epidemiologic, level III.

The effects of these drugs on mood and anxiety have been studied in both humans and animals. In humans, psilocybin and LSD have been shown to produce a rapid and sustained reduction in anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening diseases. In animals, the effects of these drugs on neurotransmission have been studied using in vivo microdialysis and in vitro receptor binding techniques. The results of these studies suggest that psilocybin and LSD produce their effects by modulating the activity of several neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic systems. The effects of these drugs on mood and anxiety and the modulatory effects of 5-HT2 receptor psychotomimetics on neurotransmission are reviewed in this article.^\n

The subjects were tested on 3 occasions, 1 week apart, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The subjects were given either psilocybin, LSD, or placebo in a randomized order. The subjects were tested on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) before and after drug administration. The POMS is a 65-item self-report questionnaire that measures six mood states: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. The IRI is a 28-item self-report questionnaire that measures four aspects of empathy: perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress. The results showed that psilocybin and LSD produced significant increases in the mood states of tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment.

Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy on alcohol use disorder: a phase 2 clinical trial.^\nPsilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic, has shown promise in the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for AUD. In this phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 93 participants with moderate-to-severe AUD were randomized to receive psilocybin (n = 47) or placebo (n = 46) in two 25-mg oral doses, 7 days apart, with psychotherapy. The primary outcome was the percentage of heavy drinking days (HDDs) in the 12 weeks after the second dose. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of HDDs in the 24 weeks after the second dose, the percentage of days abstinent, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and vital signs. The percentage of HDDs in the 12 weeks after the second dose was 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1 to 15.1) in the psilocybin group and 19.4% (95% CI, 14.5 to 24.3) in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The percentage of HDDs in the 24 weeks after the second dose was 14.2% (95% CI, 9.9 to 18.5) in the psilocybin group and 22.1% (95% CI, 17.0 to 27.2) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The percentage of days abstinent in the 12 weeks after the second dose was 50.0% (95% CI, 40.0 to 60.0) in the psilocybin group and 33.3% (95% CI, 23.3 to 43.3) in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The percentage of days abstinent in the 24 weeks after the second dose was 50.0% (95% CI, 40.0 to 60.0) in the psilocybin group and 33.3% (95% CI, 23.3 to 43.3) in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The AUDIT score in the 12 weeks after the second dose was 4.0 (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.0) in the psilocybin group and 6.0 (95% CI, 5.0 to 7.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The AUDIT score in the 24 weeks after the second dose was 4.0 (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.0) in the psilocybin group and 6.0 (95% CI, 5.0 to 7.0) in the placebo group (P = 0.01). The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and dizziness. No serious adverse events occurred. Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in HDDs and an increase in days abstinent compared with placebo. Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy was well tolerated and safe. (Funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03775200.).

RESULTS: Prolactin response to d-fenfluramine was slightly blunted in female ecstasy users. Both male user samples exhibited a weak prolactin response to d-fenfluramine, but this was weaker in the group of cannabis users. Baseline prolactin and prolactin response to d-fenfluramine were associated with the extent of previous cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrinological abnormalities of ecstasy users may be closely related to their coincident cannabis use. Cannabis use may be an important confound in endocrinological studies of ecstasy users and should be looked for more systematically in future studies.","***TASK***

This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters. With the psilocybin investigation, statistically significant reductions in anxiety were identified at various points over the 6‐month follow‐up period, along with a notable reduction in depression scores at the 6‐month data point. The MDMA study demonstrated a drug effect size of 1.4 for reduction of social anxiety. Conclusions: Both the psilocybin and MDMA studies demonstrated trends toward therapeutic efficacy, with amelioration of identified target symptoms.

The aim of the present study is to address this limitation. Objectives Extending our previous research, we augmented the range laboratory measures of PM by employing the CAMPROMPT test battery to investigate the impact of illicit drug use on prospective remembering in a sample of cannabis only, ecstasy/polydrug and non-users of illicit drugs, separating event and time-based PM performance. We also administered measures of executive function and retrospective memory in order to establish whether ecstasy/polydrug deficits in PM were mediated by group differences in these processes. Results Ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on both event and time-based prospective memory tasks in comparison to both cannabis only and non-user groups. Furthermore, it was found that across the whole sample, better retrospective memory and executive functioning was associated with superior PM performance. Nevertheless, this association did not mediate the drug-related effects that were observed. Consistent with our previous study, recreational use of cocaine was linked to PM deficits. Conclusions PM deficits have again been found among ecstasy/polydrug users, which appear to be unrelated to group differences in executive function and retrospective memory.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms. It has been used in religious and shamanic rituals for thousands of years. In the 1950s and 1960s, psilocybin was used in psychotherapy and in the treatment of alcoholism. However, the use of psilocybin was discontinued in the 1970s because of the lack of controlled studies and the emergence of the anti-drug movement.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms. It has been used in religious and shamanic rituals for thousands of years. In the 1950s and 1960s, psilocybin was used in psychotherapy and in the treatment of alcoholism. However, the use of psilocybin was discontinued in the 1970s because of the lack of controlled studies and the emergence of the anti-drug movement.

4252,"Effects of Ketamine Versus Midazolam on Neurocognition at 24 Hours in Depressed Patients With Suicidal Ideation.^\nObjective: Subanesthetic ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in some depressed patients. Its effects on neurocognitive functioning in such individuals with significant suicidal ideation is not well understood, even though certain neurocognitive deficits are associated with suicide behavior beyond clinical symptoms. Methods: In this study, depressed patients with clinically significant suicidal ideation (n = 78) underwent neuropsychological testing before and 1 day after double-blind treatment with intravenous ketamine (n = 39) or midazolam (n = 39). A subgroup randomized to midazolam whose ideation did not remit after initial infusion received open ketamine and additional neurocognitive testing a day after this treatment. The primary outcome was change in performance on this neurocognitive battery. The study was conducted between November 2012 and January 2017. Results: Blinded ketamine produced rapid improvement in suicidal ideation and mood in comparison to midazolam, as we had reported previously. Ketamine, relative to midazolam, was also associated with specific improvement in reaction time (Choice RT) and interference processing/cognitive control (computerized Stroop task)-the latter a measure that has been associated with past suicide attempt in depression. In midazolam nonremitters later treated with open ketamine and retested, reaction time and interference processing/cognitive control also improved relative to both of their prior assessments. Neurocognitive improvement, however, was not correlated with changes in depression, suicidal thinking, or general mood. Conclusions: Overall, ketamine was found to have a positive therapeutic effect on neurocognition 1 day after treatment on at least 1 measure associated with suicidal behavior in the context of depression.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide on mood and anxiety of subjects with a personal or family history of alcoholism.^\nPsilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are hallucinogenic drugs that have been reported to produce a sense of well-being and euphoria in normal subjects. The present study was designed to determine whether these drugs would produce similar effects in subjects with a personal or family history of alcoholism. The subjects were 12 male alcoholics and 12 male nonalcoholic controls. The subjects were given 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin and 0.1 mg/kg of LSD in a double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover design. The subjects were tested on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after each drug administration. The results indicated that psilocybin and LSD produced a significant decrease in the POMS depression-dejection and anxiety-hostility subscales and a significant increase in the POMS vigor-activity subscale. The STAI state anxiety scores were significantly decreased by both drugs. The STAI trait anxiety scores were significantly decreased by psilocybin but not by LSD.

METHODS/PROCEDURES: In our pilot study, 45 patients with major depressive disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria) in the age range of 18 to 70 years who were determined suitable candidates for ECT got randomly divided into 3 equal groups. Each group received one of these treatment modalities: 0.5 mg/kg of IM ketamine; 1 mg/kg of oral ketamine; and ECT in 6 to 9 sessions during 3 weeks. Depression and suicidal ideation scores were recorded using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, respectively, at baseline, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks within the intervention. The measurements were repeated 1 week and 1 month after the end of the intervention as well. Vital signs and adverse effects were noted. Finally, satisfaction levels of patients for each method were recorded and compared between groups. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores significantly improved in all groups compared with baseline with no significant differences between the 3 groups. The adverse effects for ketamine-consuming groups such as dissociative symptoms were brief and transient, whereas memory loss for the ECT group remained up to 1 month in some patients. Ketamine-receiving groups preferred it more than ECT. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Oral and IM ketamine probably have equal antidepressant in addition to more antisuicidal effects compared with ECT but had less cognitive adverse effects and higher preference by patients. Thereby, ketamine can be an alternative method in the treatment of patients with severe and/or suicidal MDD.","***TASK***

METHODS/PROCEDURES: In our pilot study, 45 patients with major depressive disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria) in the age range of 18 to 70 years who were determined suitable candidates for ECT got randomly divided into 3 equal groups. Each group received one of these treatment modalities: 0.5 mg/kg of IM ketamine; 1 mg/kg of oral ketamine; and ECT in 6 to 9 sessions during 3 weeks. Depression and suicidal ideation scores were recorded using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, respectively, at baseline, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks within the intervention. The measurements were repeated 1 week and 1 month after the end of the intervention as well. Vital signs and adverse effects were noted. Finally, satisfaction levels of patients for each method were recorded and compared between groups. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores significantly improved in all groups compared with baseline with no significant differences between the 3 groups. The adverse effects for ketamine-consuming groups such as dissociative symptoms were brief and transient, whereas memory loss for the ECT group remained up to 1 month in some patients. Ketamine-receiving groups preferred it more than ECT. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Oral and IM ketamine probably have equal antidepressant in addition to more antisuicidal effects compared with ECT but had less cognitive adverse effects and higher preference by patients. Thereby, ketamine can be an alternative method in the treatment of patients with severe and/or suicidal MDD.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nPURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that affects 7.7 million adults in the United States. Although several pharmacologic treatments are available, many patients do not respond to these treatments. Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with PTSD. METHODS/PROCEDURES: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in patients with PTSD. Patients were randomized to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (normal saline) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score at 24 hours. Secondary outcome measures included the CAPS score at 1 week, the CAPS score at 1 month, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 hours. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled in the study. The mean CAPS score at 24 hours was 4.5 points lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval, -9.5 to 0.5; P =.08). The mean MADRS score at 24 hours was 7.5 points lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval, -13.5 to -1.5; P =.02). The mean CAPS score at 1 week was 5.5 points lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval, -11.5 to 0.5; P =.07). The mean CAPS score at 1 month was 4.5 points lower in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval, -10.5 to 1.5; P =.13). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine may have a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with PTSD. Further studies are needed to determine whether ketamine is an effective treatment for PTSD.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 1, 0, 0]"
4404,"The Effects of Ecstasy (MDMA) on Brain Serotonin Transporters Are Dependent on Age-of-First Exposure in Recreational Users and Animals.^\nRationale and Objective: Little is known on the effects of ecstasy (MDMA, a potent 5-HT-releaser and neurotoxin) exposure on brain development in teenagers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans, like previous observations made in animals, the effects of MDMA on the 5-HT system are dependent on age-of-first exposure. Methods: 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in the frontal cortex and midbrain were assessed with [123I]β-CIT single photon emission computed tomography in 33 users of ecstasy. Subjects were stratified for early-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 14-18 years; developing brain), and late-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 18-36 years; mature brain). In parallel, we investigated the effects of age experimentally with MDMA in early-exposed (adolescent) rats and late-exposed (adult) rats using the same radioligand. Results: On average, five years after first exposure, we found a strong inverse relationship, wherein age-at-first exposure predicted 79% of the midbrain SERT variability in early (developing brain) exposed ecstasy users, whereas this was only 0.3% in late (mature brain) exposed users (p = 0.007). No such effect was observed in the frontal cortex. In rats, a significant age-BY-treatment effect (p<0.01) was observed as well, however only in the frontal cortex. Conclusions: These age-related effects most likely reflect differences in the maturational stage of the 5-HT projection fields at age-at-first exposure and enhanced outgrowth of the 5-HT system due to 5-HT's neurotrophic effects.

Twelve healthy recreational ecstasy users participated in an experimental study conducted according to a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled three-way cross-over design. MDMA improved psychomotor performance, such as movement speed and tracking performance in a single task, as well as in a divided attention task. MDMA impaired the ability to predict object movement under divided attention.

INPUT: Dissociable effects of a single dose of ecstasy (MDMA) on psychomotor skills and attentional performance.^\nEcstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a psychoactive recreational drug widely used by young people visiting dance parties, and has been associated with poor cognitive function. The current study assessed the influence of a single dose of MDMA 75 mg and alcohol 0.5 g/kg on cognition, psychomotor performance and driving-related task performance. Twelve healthy recreational ecstasy users participated in an experimental study conducted according to a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled three-way cross-over design. MDMA improved psychomotor performance, such as movement speed and tracking performance in a single task, as well as in a divided attention task. MDMA impaired the ability to predict object movement under divided attention. However, the inability to accurately predict object movement after MDMA may indicate impairment of particular performance skills relevant to driving. There was no effect of MDMA on visual search, planning or retrieval from semantic memory.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring hallucinogen that is structurally related to serotonin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on mood, anxiety, and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers were given a single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Mood, anxiety, and cognitive function were assessed before and after drug administration. Psilocybin produced a rapid onset of subjective effects, including visual hallucinations, synaesthesia, and altered perception of time and space. Psilocybin also produced a rapid onset of anxiolytic effects, which were sustained for at least 6 h. There was no evidence of impairment of cognitive function. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of anxiety.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
4711,"Ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder: six-month follow-up study.^\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the psychiatric symptoms manifested by persons diagnosed for the first time as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder and to explore the evolution of their symptoms over a 6-month period. DESIGN: Observational study with a 6-month follow-up. METHOD: The subjects studied were 32 ecstasy consumers who were treated at two drug-dependency outpatient centers for hallucinatory-delusive manifestations and who were diagnosed as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. For the assessment of the intensity of the syndrome and its follow-up, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were used at the outset and after 1, 3 and 6 months. All subjects received treatment with olanzapine. RESULTS: The treatment program was completed by 96.9% of the patients. At the baseline assessment, a high incidence of symptoms of a severe psychiatric disorder was observed. From the first month the psychotic symptoms (BPRS) were considerably reduced with treatment, with the most severe positive symptoms remitting in the first 3 months. The three assessment indicators (BPRS, HDRS and CGI) showed a statistically significant clinical reduction over the 6 months of the assessment period. Furthermore, no relevant side effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: In its initial manifestations, a drug-induced psychotic syndrome includes marked symptoms meeting the criteria of a severe psychotic disorder, with the presence of considerable positive and negative symptoms. Olanzapine has been shown to be very effective in these situations and its use is suggested as first-choice therapy.","***TASK***

4728,"Patients' recovery and non-recovery narratives after intravenous ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) ketamine is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A large data base is confirmatory and steadily expanding. Qualitative studies can inform best practices and suggest new research directions. As part of a clinical trial designed to identify biomarkers of ketamine response, a qualitative study was conducted to characterize experiences with: receiving infusions; recovering or not recovering from depression; and beliefs about why ketamine worked or did not work. METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression received three IV ketamine infusions in a two-week period and were characterized as remitters or non-remitters via symptom reduction 24 h after the third infusion. Qualitative interviews of a subset of participants were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive methods. Themes were derived and compared across a broader construct of recovery status. RESULTS: Of the 21 participants, nine (43 %) were characterized as having experienced remission and 12 (57 %) non-remission. Of the 12 non-remitters, five were characterized as having experienced partial recovery based on their subjective experiences, reporting substantial benefit from ketamine infusions despite non-remission status based on scale measurements. Attributions for ketamine's effects included biological and experiential mechanisms. Among non-remitters there was risk of disappointment when adding another failed treatment. LIMITATIONS: A more diverse sample may have yielded different themes. Different patients had different amounts of time elapsed between ketamine infusions and qualitative interview. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods may enhance researchers' characterization of IV ketamine's impact on treatment-resistant depression. While requiring confirmation, patients may benefit from a preparatory milieu that prepares them for multiple recovery pathways; decouples the psychedelic experience from clinical outcomes; and addresses potential risks of another failed treatment.","***TASK***

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mood and anxiety in subjects with a history of psilocybin use. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with a history of psilocybin use were recruited from the community. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) or LSD (0.1 mg/kg) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Mood and anxiety were assessed before and after drug administration using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Psilocybin and LSD produced significant increases in the POMS total mood disturbance score and the STAI state anxiety score. The POMS total mood disturbance score was significantly higher after psilocybin than after LSD. The STAI state anxiety score was significantly higher after psilocybin than after LSD. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and LSD produced significant increases in mood disturbance and state anxiety in subjects with a history of psilocybin use.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers: a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning before and after drug administration. The fMRI task involved the presentation of emotional and neutral faces. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly increased the subjective experience of positive mood and decreased the subjective experience of negative mood. Ketamine also significantly increased the subjective experience of dissociation. There were no significant differences in the neural correlates of emotional processing between the ketamine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of ketamine does not appear to have a significant effect on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. This may be due to the fact that the effects of ketamine on emotional processing are state-dependent and require repeated administration.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 1, 0, 0]"
5139,"A Meta-Analysis of Placebo-Controlled Trials of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy.^\nAfter a two-decade hiatus in which research on psychedelics was essentially halted, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions have begun to be published. We identified nine randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy published since 1994. Studies examined psilocybin, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), ayahuasca (which contains a combination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala monoamine oxidase inhibitor alkaloids), and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). We compared the standardized mean difference between the experimental and placebo control group at the primary endpoint.

Here we evaluate six phase 2 trials in a pooled analysis to determine the study design for phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. METHODS: Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials at five study sites were conducted from April 2004 to February 2017. Active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg, n = 72) or placebo/control doses (0-40 mg, n = 31) were administered to individuals with PTSD during manualized psychotherapy sessions in two or three 8-h sessions spaced a month apart. Three non-drug 90-min therapy sessions preceded the first MDMA exposure, and three to four followed each experimental session. RESULTS: After two blinded experimental sessions, the active group had significantly greater reductions in CAPS-IV total scores from baseline than the control group [MMRM estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 22.0 (5.17), P < 0.001]. The between-group Cohen's d effect size was 0.8, indicating a large treatment effect. After two experimental sessions, more participants in the active group (54.2%) did not meet CAPS-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria than the control group (22.6%). Depression symptom improvement on the BDI-II was greatest for the active group compared to the control group, although only trended towards significant group differences [MMRM, estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 6.0 (3.03), P = 0.053].

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of intravenous ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant major depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: This was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of intravenous ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Patients were randomized to receive a single infusion of ketamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline to 24 hours in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients were randomized to receive ketamine (n = 34) or placebo (n = 34). The mean change from baseline to 24 hours in the MADRS total score was significantly greater in the ketamine group than in the placebo group (mean difference, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-13.5; P =.001). The mean change from baseline to 24 hours in the MADRS total score was significantly greater in the ketamine 0.5-mg/kg group than in the placebo group (mean difference, 10.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.7-16.3; P =.003). The mean change from baseline to 24 hours in the MADRS total score was significantly greater in the ketamine 0.8-mg/kg group than in the placebo group (mean difference, 10.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.7-16.3; P =.003). The mean change from baseline to 24 hours in the MADRS total score was significantly greater in the ketamine 0.2-mg/kg group than in the placebo group (mean difference, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-13.2; P =.03).

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. FINDINGS: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19-4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04-2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100-125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p<0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment. INTERPRETATION: Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. FINDINGS: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19-4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04-2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100-125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p<0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment. INTERPRETATION: Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

5717,"Functional MRI study of working memory in MDMA users.^\nRATIONALE: Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is known to cause degeneration of serotonin nerve terminals after acute doses in animals. Similarly, behavioral studies in human MDMA users regularly find abnormalities in memory, mood, and impulse control. However, studies of brain function using brain imaging in MDMA users have been less consistent. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whether individuals with a self-reported history of MDMA use would differ from non-MDMA using controls on activation while performing a working memory task. METHODS: Fifteen MDMA using subjects and 19 non-MDMA using controls underwent fMRI scanning while performing the immediate and delayed memory task (IMT/DMT). The study was based on a block design in which the delayed memory task (DMT) alternated with the immediate memory task (IMT), which served as a control condition. FMRI scans were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner, using a gradient echo echoplanar pulse sequence. RESULTS: Random effects SPM99 analysis showed significantly greater activation (whole volume corrected cluster P<0.05) during the DMT relative to the IMT in the MDMA subjects compared with the control subjects in the medial superior frontal gyrus, in the thalamus extending into putamen, and in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Although these effects could be due to other drugs used by MDMA users, these results are consistent with behavioral problems that are associated with MDMA use, and with animal studies on the effects of MDMA on brain function.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic substance that has been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The mechanism of action of psilocybin in OCD is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may act by enhancing attention. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg), and placebo. Sustained attention was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased the number of correct responses on the CPT, whereas methylphenidate significantly decreased the number of correct responses. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that psilocybin enhances sustained attention, whereas methylphenidate impairs it. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that psilocybin may act by enhancing attention in OCD.

Methods: Aspects of cognitive functioning in 104 ecstasy users and 103 nonusers obtained from our previous studies were reanalysed to explore the extent to which ecstasy-related group differences were attributable to differences in sleep quality. Cognitive function was assessed via the computation span test, consonant updating, paired associate learning, syllogistic reasoning and word fluency. Sleep quality was measured via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Results: Ecstasy users performed worse than nonusers on all cognitive measures.

Difficulty in abstract thinking was correlated with pronounced activations in prefrontal as well as in anterior cingulate regions, whereas hyperactivations in the left superior temporal gyrus were found in association with a lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation. In the absence of behavioral impairments during verbal fluency, NMDAR blocking evoked psychopathological symptoms and cortical activations in regions previously reported in schizophrenia patients. The results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDAR dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring hallucinogen that has been used in religious and shamanic rituals for thousands of years. It is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and has been shown to produce profound alterations in mood and perception. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on mood and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) or placebo. Mood and cognitive function were assessed before and after drug administration. Psilocybin produced a rapid onset of subjective effects, including visual hallucinations, synaesthesia, and altered perception of time and space. The effects of psilocybin were associated with a significant increase in positive mood and a significant decrease in negative mood. There was no significant effect of psilocybin on cognitive function. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin produces a rapid onset of subjective effects, including visual hallucinations, synaesthesia, and altered perception of time and space. The effects of psilocybin were associated with a significant increase in positive mood and a significant decrease in negative mood. There was no significant effect of psilocybin on cognitive function.

6108,"Ketamine Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression.^\nWorldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT including a prior medical work‐up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss. Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine. The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24. Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated administration. This longitudinal, multi‐centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN‐BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network. A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm. Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule. Participants in the ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine months, or until they leave the study or the study is terminated. Throughout the study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be conducted. Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute's Centre for Ontario Data Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five sites. The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster therapeutic action, has less side effects, requires fewer/shorter hospitalizations for patients, and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols. Through the discovery of biomarkers to predict ECT or ketamine response or non‐response, the anticipated effective treatment could be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients, thereby ensuring a more time‐efficient intervention. Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the randomization phase, responders may move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders may move to the crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy. During the crossover phase, participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the crossover phase, responders will move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders will exit the study. During the maintenance phase, participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for one month, treatment once every two weeks for two months, and monthly treatment for three months. Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment, they may return to treatments once every two weeks. Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in order to maintain a clinical response. Both treatment arms will have a follow‐up visit during month seven.","***TASK***

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that affects 7.7 million adults in the United States. Although several pharmacologic treatments are available, none are consistently effective. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in 24 adults with PTSD. Participants received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the CAPS total score at 72 hours and 1 week, the PTSD Checklist (PCL) total score at 24 hours, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score at 24 hours. Results: The mean CAPS total score decreased from 81.0 (SD = 12.0) at baseline to 68.8 (SD = 16.0) at 24 hours in the ketamine group and from 80.8 (SD = 12.0) at baseline to 78.8 (SD = 14.0) at 24 hours in the placebo group. The difference in the CAPS total score between the groups was 9.0 (95% CI = -0.3 to 18.3; P =.06). The difference in the CAPS total score between the groups at 72 hours was 10.0 (95% CI = 0.1 to 20.0; P =.05). The difference in the PCL total score between the groups at 24 hours was 9.0 (95% CI = 0.1 to 18.0; P =.05). The difference in the HAM-D total score between the groups at 24 hours was 4.0 (95% CI = -2.0 to 10.0; P =.19). Conclusions: A single infusion of ketamine was not superior to placebo in reducing PTSD symptoms in this small sample of adults with PTSD.

INPUT: Investigating the Mechanisms of the Effects of Psilocybin on Visual Perception and Visual Representations in the Brain.^\nThe long‐term objective of this project is to characterize how psilocybin affects visual perception and the brain's representation of the visual environment. We know that psilocybin alters aspects of visual perception, but the underlying brain mechanisms contributing to these effects are poorly understood. The proposed work will address these questions in a large, diverse sample of healthy human subjects by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the brain's responses to visual stimuli. The proposed research will document which brain areas mediate the effects of psilocybin. The technique of fMRI will be employed to measure brain activity in different brain areas while subjects are performing a visual perceptual task.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuroimaging studies^\nPsilocybin is a classic psychedelic drug that has been used for centuries in religious and shamanic rituals. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, with a number of clinical trials investigating its efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction. However, the mechanisms by which psilocybin exerts its effects on the brain are not well understood. In this review, we systematically review the neuroimaging literature on psilocybin to identify the brain regions that are most consistently affected by the drug. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the mechanisms of action of psilocybin and its potential therapeutic applications.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide on mood and anxiety: a systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are hallucinogenic drugs that have been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. They are also used recreationally, and their use has been associated with adverse psychological effects. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mood and anxiety. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. The search was limited to English-language articles published between January 1, 1966, and December 31, 2012. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included in the review. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design, sample size, and outcome measures. The majority of studies were conducted in healthy volunteers. The studies were grouped into 3 categories: (1) studies that examined the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mood and anxiety in healthy volunteers, (2) studies that examined the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mood and anxiety in patients with psychiatric disorders, and (3) studies that examined the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mood and anxiety in patients with terminal illness. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the studies suggest that psilocybin and LSD have the potential to induce transient mood and anxiety symptoms in healthy volunteers and patients with psychiatric disorders. However, the results of the studies in patients with terminal illness suggest that psilocybin and LSD may have the potential to improve mood and anxiety in this population. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA. Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled trial. The single oral dose conditions were: mephedrone 200 mg, MDMA 100 mg, and placebo. Outcome variables included physiological, subjective, and psychomotor effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02232789). Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. It elicited stimulant-like effects, euphoria, and well-being, and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration. Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h, respectively. The elimination half-life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA. In a similar manner to MDMA, mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability. Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects, probably related to its short elimination half-life, could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

INPUT: Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^\nMephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy).

At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration. This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA.

6837,"Psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of human studies.^\nPsilocybin is increasingly studied for its antidepressant effect, but its optimal dosage for depression remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and a dose-response meta-analysis to find the optimal dosage of psilocybin to reduce depression scores. Following our protocol (CRD 42022220190) multiple electronic databases were searched from their inception until February 2023, to identify double-blind randomized placebo-controlled (RCTs) fixed-dose trials evaluating the use of psilocybin for adult patients with primary or secondary depression. A one-stage dose-response meta-analysis with restricted cubic splines was used. Cochrane risk of bias was used to assess risk of bias. Our analysis included seven studies with a total of 489 participants. Among these, four studies focused on primary depression (N = 366), including one study with patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. The remaining three studies examined secondary depression (N = 123). The determined 95% effective doses per day (ED95) were 8.92, 24.68, and 36.08 mg/70 kg for patients with secondary depression, primary depression, and both subgroups, respectively. We observed significant dose-response associations for all curves, each plateauing at different levels, except for the bell-shaped curve observed in the case of secondary depression. Additionally, we found significant dose-response associations for various side effects, including physical discomfort, blood pressure increase, nausea/vomiting, headache/migraine, and the risk of prolonged psychosis. In conclusion, we discovered specific ED95 values for different populations, indicating higher ED95 values for treatment-resistant depression, primary depression, and secondary depression groups.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety disorders: A systematic review.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been studied for its potential therapeutic effects. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety disorders. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or open-label trials that examined the effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety disorders. A total of 12 studies were included in the review. The majority of studies were RCTs (n = 10), with the remaining two being open-label trials. The most common mood disorder studied was major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 7), followed by anxiety disorders (n = 4). The most common anxiety disorder studied was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 3). The majority of studies (n = 9) found that psilocybin was effective in reducing symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders. The most common adverse effects reported were transient anxiety and paranoia. In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that psilocybin may be effective in reducing symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosing and administration of psilocybin for these disorders.

In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers.^\nThe effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. The primary outcome measure was the number of correct responses on a visual vigilance task. Secondary outcome measures were the number of false alarms, the number of omissions, and the reaction time. Psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) and methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of correct responses compared with placebo. The number of false alarms was significantly reduced by psilocybin and methylphenidate. The number of omissions was significantly reduced by methylphenidate. The reaction time was significantly reduced by psilocybin and methylphenidate. The results suggest that psilocybin and methylphenidate improve sustained attention.

7414,"Ketamine or Placebo in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Undergoing Palliative Care: preliminary Results from the KODIAC Trial.^\nBackground/aims: To report preliminary results from the KODIAC study, designed to evaluate the effect of intravenous ketamine for patients with cancer diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and undergoing palliative care (PC). Methods: KODIAC is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist. The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) 3 weeks post‐intervention. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04471818). Results: Currently, 50% of the calculated sample has been accrued. Eight patients (n=4 controls; n=4 experimental) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups, as well as baseline BEDS scores. Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1‐week post‐intervention. At three weeks post intervention, patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm (3 [SD: 2.160] vs. 11.75 [SD:3.594]; p=0.006). The most common adverse event was post‐infusion drowsiness and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti‐depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care. These preliminary observations require confirmation once the study completes accrual but shed light on the potent effect and safety profile of ketamine for this patient population, warranting further investigation should the final findings be consistent.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of refractory depression.^\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite the availability of numerous antidepressant medications, a significant proportion of patients with MDD do not respond to treatment. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression. Methods: Patients with MDD who had failed to respond to at least 1 antidepressant medication were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score from baseline to 24 hours after the infusion. Results: A total of 68 patients were randomized to receive ketamine (n = 34) or placebo (n = 34). The mean HDRS-17 score decreased by 8.5 points in the ketamine group and by 1.9 points in the placebo group (P <.001). The response rate (defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the HDRS-17 score) was 71% in the ketamine group and 28% in the placebo group (P <.001). The remission rate (defined as a HDRS-17 score of 7 or less) was 36% in the ketamine group and 0% in the placebo group (P <.001). The mean time to relapse was 13 days in the ketamine group and 4 days in the placebo group (P =.02). Conclusions: A single intravenous infusion of ketamine was associated with a rapid and robust antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant depression. These findings suggest that ketamine may be an effective treatment for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

The present study examined the effects of these drugs on mood and anxiety in subjects with a personal or family history of alcoholism. Subjects were 20 healthy volunteers with a personal or family history of alcoholism and 20 healthy volunteers with no personal or family history of alcoholism. Subjects were administered psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), LSD (0.1 mg/kg), and placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Mood and anxiety were assessed before and after each drug administration. Psilocybin and LSD produced similar increases in anxiety and decreases in mood in both groups of subjects.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms. It has been used in religious and shamanic rituals for thousands of years. In the 1950s and 1960s, psilocybin was used in psychotherapy and in the treatment of alcoholism. However, the use of psilocybin in psychiatry was abandoned in the 1970s. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin. This study investigated the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. The study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change in the intensity of the psychedelic experience. The secondary outcome measures were the changes in mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. The results showed that psilocybin produced a significant increase in the intensity of the psychedelic experience. There were also significant increases in mood and decreases in anxiety and psychotic symptoms. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin has therapeutic potential in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms.

METHODS: Participants were 8 healthy male volunteers who were naïve to ketamine (mean age: 28 years). Ketamine (0.23 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.64 mg/kg/h) and placebo infusions were administered in a double-blind, randomised order, during 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions. Each fMRI session consisted of a verbal self-monitoring task in which auditory feedback was experimentally modified. RESULTS: Ketamine was associated with psychotic and dissociative symptoms. Participants made more misattributions of distorted self-generated speech (P < 0.02) during the ketamine infusion. Ketamine led to reduced activation in the left superior temporal cortex during self-distorted speech, regardless of whether the speech was identified correctly or not, as compared to the placebo infusion. Misidentification of speech that had been distorted was not associated with any increase in brain activation in during the placebo infusion, however ketamine-induced misattributions were associated with a relative increase in left superior temporal cortex activation.

9113,"The effects of multitasking on psychological stress reactivity in recreational users of cannabis and MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is associated with psychobiological and neurocognitive deficits. Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.","***TASK***

Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.

9119,"A systematic review of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health: An evaluation of the current wave of research and suggestions for the future.^\nResearch on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research. Despite promising results, further work is needed to determine which psychedelic is best suited for diverse mental health conditions, the most appropriate type of psychotherapy to employ, and the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying clinical benefits.

Methods: We examined data from a US representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults from the 2015–2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 241,675). We evaluated whether past-year use of specific hallucinogens (i.e., LSD, DMT/AMT/Foxy, salvia divinorum, ecstasy [MDMA/Molly], ketamine) is associated with reporting past-year serious psychological distress (SPD), major depressive episode (MDE), and suicidality. Generalized linear models using Poisson and log link were used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and past-year use of various other illegal drugs. Results: LSD use was associated with an increased likelihood of MDE (aPR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.10–1.37) and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34).

METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study trail, healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9% saline) or placebo (5 ml of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms, which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) score of pain at 2 days postpartum. This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR1900022464. RESULTS: Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019, 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated: 165 (50%) to the ketamine group and 165 (50%) to the placebo group. There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum (13.1% vs. 22.6%, respectively; p = .029). However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p = .209) and 1 month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = .319). The NRS score of wound pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.0 ± 1.0, respectively; p < .001) and uterine contraction pain (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.1 ± 0.9, respectively; p < .001) was lower in the ketamine group at 2 days postpartum compared with placebo group. The prevalence of headache, hallucination, and dizziness was higher in the ketamine group than the placebo group during the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Operative intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg) can reduce the postpartum depressive symptoms for 1 week. The long-time effect is remained to be seen.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

INPUT: The effect of ketamine on the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ketamine in the treatment of depression. The primary outcome was the response rate. The secondary outcomes were the remission rate, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score, and the adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 15 RCTs involving 1,008 patients were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that ketamine was superior to placebo in terms of the response rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28-1.81, P < 0.00001), the remission rate (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.28-1.81, P < 0.00001), and the HAMD score (mean difference [MD] = -3.45, 95% CI: -4.78 to -2.12, P < 0.00001). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that ketamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of depression in the short term (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.28-1.81, P < 0.00001), the long term (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.28-1.81, P < 0.00001), and the maintenance treatment (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.28-1.81, P < 0.00001).

9446,"Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.","***TASK***
