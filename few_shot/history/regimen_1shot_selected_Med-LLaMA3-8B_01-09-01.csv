INPUT: Relationships between reduction in symptoms and restoration of function and wellbeing: Outcomes of the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS).^\nRecovery of functioning is integral to successful treatment outcomes in depressive illness. Optimal antidepressant treatment results in both symptomatic remission and functional recovery. Oral ketamine rapidly reduces suicidality and depression; however, reports of functional and wellbeing outcomes are lacking. This study examines participants' social and occupational functioning and wellbeing outcomes in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes. Results suggest that reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation may be necessary but not sufficient for full restoration of function and wellbeing in antisuicidal and antidepressant therapy, including clinical trials.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants completed a facial emotion recognition task during scanning. The task consisted of 60 trials, each of which presented a face with a neutral expression and a face with a fearful expression. Participants were asked to indicate whether the two faces were the same or different. The results showed that ketamine increased the accuracy of emotion recognition. The fMRI results showed that ketamine increased the activation of the left amygdala and the left fusiform gyrus in response to fearful faces. Ketamine also increased the activation of the left amygdala in response to neutral faces. These results suggest that a single dose of ketamine increases the neural response to emotional stimuli in healthy volunteers. This may be related to the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 1, 0]"
3537,"Gray matter volume of rostral anterior cingulate cortex predicts rapid antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nKetamine was recently approved for treatment resistant depression. However, despite its therapeutic potential, about 50% of patients do not show improvement under this therapy. In this prospective two-site study, we investigated baseline brain structural predictors for rapid symptom improvement after a single subanesthetic ketamine infusion. Furthermore, given the preclinical evidence and findings from a pilot study in a clinical population that ketamine induces rapid neuroplasticity, we performed an exploratory investigation of macroscopic changes 24 h post-treatment. T1-weighted MRI brain images from 33 depressed patients were acquired before and 24 h after a single ketamine infusion and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Additionally, we performed a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of structures that have previously been shown to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine: bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that greater baseline volume of the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) significantly predicts rapid symptom reduction. The right ACC showed the same association in the ROI analysis, while the other regions yielded no significant results. Exploratory follow-up analyses revealed no volumetric changes 24 h after treatment. This is the first study reporting an association between pretreatment gray matter volume of the bilateral rACC and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. Results are in line with previous investigations, which highlighted the potential of the rACC as a biomarker for response prediction to different antidepressant treatments.

Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min.

INPUT: A systematic review of the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The search was limited to studies published in English between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were included in the review. The studies included 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 open-label studies. The RCTs included 2 studies of intravenous ketamine, 2 studies of intranasal ketamine, 1 study of intramuscular ketamine, 1 study of sublingual ketamine, 1 study of intravenous esketamine, and 3 studies of intravenous ketamine plus antidepressants. The open-label studies included 1 study of intravenous ketamine and 1 study of intravenous esketamine. The results of the RCTs showed that ketamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of depression. The results of the open-label studies showed that ketamine was effective in the treatment of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine is an effective treatment for depression. However, the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression needs to be confirmed by more RCTs.

The open-label studies included 1 study of intravenous ketamine and 1 study of intravenous esketamine. The results of the RCTs showed that ketamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of depression. The results of the open-label studies showed that ketamine was effective in the treatment of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine is an effective treatment for depression. However, the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression needs to be confirmed by more RCTs.

382,"Spectral Changes of EEG Following a 6-Week Low-Dose Oral Ketamine Treatment in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder and Chronic Suicidality.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has considerable therapeutic potential in alleviating major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality. However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n = 25) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of depression. The primary outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score. The secondary outcomes were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score, and the adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs involving 1,008 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose ketamine was superior to placebo in reducing the HAMD score (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.14 to -0.48, P < 0.00001), the MADRS score (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.14 to -0.48, P < 0.00001), and the CGI-S score (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.14 to -0.48, P < 0.00001). The results also showed that low-dose ketamine was superior to placebo in improving the CGI-I score (SMD = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.14, P < 0.00001). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the low-dose ketamine group and the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.19, P = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine is effective and safe in the treatment of depression. However, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the high risk of bias of the included studies.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 1, 0, 0]"
2117,"Ayahuasca improves emotion dysregulation in a community sample and in individuals with borderline-like traits.^\nBACKGROUND: Research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may improve mindfulness-related capacities (e.g., decentering, non-judging, and non-reacting) and emotion regulation. Previously, our group reported that ayahuasca could be a potential analogue of mindfulness practice. The main aim of the current study was to examine the effects of ayahuasca on emotional regulation and mindfulness-related capacities. Secondarily, we sought to explore the effects of ayahuasca on individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits. METHOD: This is an observational study of 45 volunteers who participated in an ayahuasca session. The volunteers completed various self-report instruments designed to measure emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)-Short Form and Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)) prior to and 24 h after the ayahuasca session. The volunteers were divided into two subgroups based on their score on the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD). Twelve participants were grouped into the BPD-like traits subgroup while the rest of them were included in the non-BPD-like subgroup. We performed within-subjects and between-group analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed significant improvements on the FFMQ subscales observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting and also significantly improved on decentering (EQ scale) and on the DERS subscales emotional non-acceptance, emotional interference, and lack of control. The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice). Based on these results, we believe that ayahuasca therapy could be of value in clinical populations, such as individuals with BPD, affected by emotion dysregulation.","***TASK***

3480,"Subjective ratings of prospective memory deficits in MDMA ('ecstasy') users.^\nChronic use of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), or 'ecstasy', is associated with significant cognitive impairments, particularly in laboratory and field tests of memory for previously encoded material. Less is known about the effects of a history of MDMA use on aspects of everyday cognitive functioning-of which prospective memory (typically characterised as 'remembering to do something at some future point') is an important aspect. Self-ratings of prospective memory among 30 regular ecstasy users (taking the drug 10 or more times per month) and 31 ecstasy-free controls were compared. Each participant completed the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, which measures self-rated error frequencies relating to three aspects of prospective memory (short-term habitual, long-term episodic and internally cued); the scale also records the use of strategies to aid remembering. Compared with non-users, ecstasy users reported significantly more self-rated errors in prospective memory, and effect which was evident after co-varying levels of other drug use. There were no significant differences in the use of strategies to aid memory. These findings provide new insights into prospective memory dysfunction in recreational drug users. Prospective memory deficits may be related to the reported serotonergic and frontal lobe deficits in chronic MDMA users. It is necessary to use more objective tasks to assess putative prospective memory deficits in ecstasy users. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","***TASK***

Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Subjective ratings of prospective memory deficits in MDMA ('ecstasy') users.^\nChronic use of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), or 'ecstasy', is associated with significant cognitive impairments, particularly in laboratory and field tests of memory for previously encoded material. Less is known about the effects of a history of MDMA use on aspects of everyday cognitive functioning-of which prospective memory (typically characterised as 'remembering to do something at some future point') is an important aspect. Self-ratings of prospective memory among 30 regular ecstasy users (taking the drug 10 or more times per month) and 31 ecstasy-free controls were compared. Each participant completed the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, which measures self-rated error frequencies relating to three aspects of prospective memory (short-term habitual, long-term episodic and internally cued); the scale also records the use of strategies to aid remembering. Compared with non-users, ecstasy users reported significantly more self-rated errors in prospective memory, and effect which was evident after co-varying levels of other drug use. There were no significant differences in the use of strategies to aid memory. These findings provide new insights into prospective memory dysfunction in recreational drug users. Prospective memory deficits may be related to the reported serotonergic and frontal lobe deficits in chronic MDMA users. It is necessary to use more objective tasks to assess putative prospective memory deficits in ecstasy users. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine that is structurally related to serotonin and is the active ingredient in the hallucinogenic mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. The effects of a single oral dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. The drug produced a dose-related increase in the frequency of visual hallucinations, illusions, and synesthesias. The effects of psilocybin were similar to those of LSD and mescaline. The drug also produced a dose-related increase in the frequency of subjective reports of anxiety, dysphoria, and paranoia. The effects of psilocybin were not significantly different from those of LSD or mescaline. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin may be useful in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

6022,"Study of the Effects of MDMA/Ecstasy on Water Regulation, Sleep, and Cognition.^\nThis is a placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, gender balanced, within‐subject study on the acute and 24 to 48 hour post dose effects (discontinuation syndrome) of MDMA on sleep architecture, water homeostasis and neurocognitive function. We will define the signs and symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy ‐ we refer to these effects as a discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post‐MDMA depression are unknown but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained 36 hours after a single dose of MDMA. Cognitive measurements will explore the acute effects of MDMA. MDMA can produce hyponatremia.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies for thousands of years and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on mood, anxiety, and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either 10 mg psilocybin or placebo in a single dose. Mood, anxiety, and cognitive function were assessed before and after drug administration. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive mood and a significant decrease in negative mood. There was also a significant increase in anxiety and a significant decrease in cognitive function. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin has the potential to be used as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. However, further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of psilocybin and to determine the optimal dose for treatment.

7573,"Modulation of the functional connectome in major depressive disorder by ketamine therapy.^\nBackground: Subanesthetic ketamine infusion therapy can produce fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients with major depression. How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales. Of these patients, n = 48 and n = 51, completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine infusions. Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks. These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment. Furthermore, following serial ketamine infusions, significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05, corrected). Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment, whereas non-remitters showed the opposite pattern. Conclusion: Results support that ketamine treatment leads to neurofunctional plasticity between distinct neural networks that are shown as disrupted in MDD patients. Cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops that encompass the SN could be a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. The results showed that ketamine significantly increased the intensity of the emotion expressed by the faces. This was associated with increased activity in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results suggest that a single dose of ketamine may increase the intensity of emotional processing by increasing the activity of the amygdala and ACC and decreasing the activity of the mPFC. This may be one of the mechanisms by which ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects.

6357,"Riluzole likely lacks antidepressant efficacy in ketamine non-responders.^\nBackground: In our primary analysis of a four‐week riluzole extension trial after open‐label ketamine in treatment‐resistant major depressive disorder (TRD), there was no significant difference in depression scores between riluzole and placebo extension (Ibrahim et al., 2012). Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders, which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders (Mathew et al., 2010). However, as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD, and, although glutamatergic, its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine's, we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non‐responders. Methods: 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥22 at screening and the day of infusion) received a single open‐label subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes. 4‐6 hours post‐infusion, subjects were randomized double‐blind to either flexible‐dose (100‐200mg/day) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis, and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule (50mg/week to a minimum of 100mg/day) for intolerable side effects. The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure. Responders and non‐responders were defined as ≥50% and<50% improvement, respectively, from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes (last pre‐randomization time point). Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within‐subjects factor and drug as a between‐subjects factor. MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate. All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model. Results: At 230 minutes post‐infusion, 32 patients were non‐responders, and 16 non‐responders were randomized to each arm. There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics (including length of illness, length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials) between groups. The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [F(1,29)=0.62, p=.44] or time [F(27,231)=1.50, p=.058]. There was also no interaction between drug and time [F(27,231)=1.15, p=.29]. This small sample size, however, may leave the study underpowered to detect a small‐to‐medium effect. In non‐responders, riluzole's maximum effect was observed at day one (d=.39) but was lost by day six. Yet, at the end of protocol, sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition ‐ placebo: 8/16 (50%) drop‐outs; riluzole: 6/16 (38%) dropouts. There was no statistically significant difference in drop‐outs between groups (p=.72), and, with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea, the remaining drop‐outs were attributed to psychiatric indications, i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood, anxiety or suicidal ideation. At day 28, there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo (6%) and no responders randomized to riluzole (drop‐outs were counted as non‐responders). Conclusions: Although potentially underpowered to detect a small‐to‐moderate‐sized effect, riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders.

54,"Ketamine for depression: where do we go from here?.^\nSince publication of the first randomized controlled trial describing rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, several reports have confirmed the potential utility of this dissociative anesthetic medication for treatment of major depressive episodes, including those associated with bipolar disorder and resistant to other medications and electroconvulsive therapy. These reports have generated several questions with respect to who might respond to ketamine, how, and for how long. To start answering these questions. We used PubMed.gov and ClinicalTrials.gov to perform a systematic review of all available published data on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and of all recently completed, ongoing, and planned studies. To date, 163 patients, primarily with treatment-resistant depression, have participated in case studies, open-label investigations, or controlled trials. All controlled trials have used a within-subject, crossover design with an inactive placebo as the control. Ketamine administration has usually involved an anaesthesiologist infusing a single, subanesthetic, intravenous dose, and required hospitalization for at least 24 hours postinfusion. Response rates in the open-label investigations and controlled trials have ranged from 25% to 85% at 24 hours postinfusion and from 14% to 70% at 72 hours postinfusion. Although adverse effects have generally been mild, some patients have experienced brief changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate. Risk-benefit analyses support further research of ketamine for individuals with severe mood disorders. However, given the paucity of randomized controlled trials, lack of an active placebo, limited data on long-term outcomes, and potential risks, ketamine administration is not recommended outside of the hospital setting.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Ketamine for depression: where do we go from here?.^\nSince publication of the first randomized controlled trial describing rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, several reports have confirmed the potential utility of this dissociative anesthetic medication for treatment of major depressive episodes, including those associated with bipolar disorder and resistant to other medications and electroconvulsive therapy. These reports have generated several questions with respect to who might respond to ketamine, how, and for how long. To start answering these questions. We used PubMed.gov and ClinicalTrials.gov to perform a systematic review of all available published data on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and of all recently completed, ongoing, and planned studies. To date, 163 patients, primarily with treatment-resistant depression, have participated in case studies, open-label investigations, or controlled trials. All controlled trials have used a within-subject, crossover design with an inactive placebo as the control. Ketamine administration has usually involved an anaesthesiologist infusing a single, subanesthetic, intravenous dose, and required hospitalization for at least 24 hours postinfusion. Response rates in the open-label investigations and controlled trials have ranged from 25% to 85% at 24 hours postinfusion and from 14% to 70% at 72 hours postinfusion. Although adverse effects have generally been mild, some patients have experienced brief changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate. Risk-benefit analyses support further research of ketamine for individuals with severe mood disorders. However, given the paucity of randomized controlled trials, lack of an active placebo, limited data on long-term outcomes, and potential risks, ketamine administration is not recommended outside of the hospital setting.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that is often refractory to treatment. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for PTSD. METHOD: Patients with PTSD (N = 45) were randomized to receive a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the CAPS total score at 72 hours and 1 week after infusion, the CAPS reexperiencing and avoidance/numbing subscale scores at 24 and 72 hours after infusion, and the CAPS total score at 1 month after infusion. RESULTS: The mean CAPS total score decreased from 75.4 at baseline to 66.9 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.4 to 71.4 in the placebo group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant (P =.14). The mean CAPS total score decreased from 75.4 at baseline to 66.9 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.4 to 71.4 in the placebo group. The difference between groups was not statistically significant (P =.14). CONCLUSIONS: A single infusion of ketamine did not result in a statistically significant improvement in PTSD symptoms compared with placebo. However, the study was underpowered to detect a small effect size. Future studies should examine the efficacy of ketamine for PTSD in larger samples and should examine the efficacy of multiple infusions of ketamine.

486,"Intraoperative ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium or pain after major surgery in older adults: an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and serious postoperative complication. Subanaesthetic ketamine is often administered intraoperatively for postoperative analgesia, and some evidence suggests that ketamine prevents delirium. The primary purpose of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of ketamine for prevention of postoperative delirium in older adults. METHODS: The Prevention of Delirium and Complications Associated with Surgical Treatments [PODCAST] study is a multicentre, international randomised trial that enrolled adults older than 60 years undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence we randomly assigned patients to one of three groups in blocks of 15 to receive placebo (normal saline), low-dose ketamine (0·5 mg/kg), or high dose ketamine (1·0 mg/kg) after induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision. Participants, clinicians, and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Delirium was assessed twice daily in the first 3 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. We did analyses by intention-to-treat and assessed adverse events. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01690988. FINDINGS: Between Feb 6, 2014, and June 26, 2016, 1360 patients were assessed, and 672 were randomly assigned, with 222 in the placebo group, 227 in the 0·5 mg/kg ketamine group, and 223 in the 1·0 mg/kg ketamine group. There was no difference in delirium incidence between patients in the combined ketamine groups and the placebo group (19·45% vs 19·82%, respectively; absolute difference 0·36%, 95% CI -6·07 to 7·38, p=0·92). There were more postoperative hallucinations (p=0·01) and nightmares (p=0·03) with increasing ketamine doses compared with placebo. Adverse events (cardiovascular, renal, infectious, gastrointestinal, and bleeding), whether viewed individually (p value for each >0·40) or collectively (36·9% in placebo, 39·6% in 0·5 mg/kg ketamine, and 40·8% in 1·0 mg/kg ketamine groups, p=0·69), did not differ significantly across groups.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that affects 7.7 million adults in the United States. Although several pharmacological treatments are available, many patients do not respond to these treatments. Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine in patients with PTSD. Thirty patients with PTSD were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score. Secondary outcome measures included the CAPS reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal subscales, the PTSD Checklist, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale. The authors found that ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in CAPS total score at 24 hours (mean difference, -11.0; 95% confidence interval, -19.0 to -3.0; p =.007) and 72 hours (mean difference, -12.0; 95% confidence interval, -20.0 to -4.0; p =.003) compared with placebo. Ketamine was also associated with a significant reduction in CAPS reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal subscale scores at 24 hours and 72 hours. The authors found no significant differences between ketamine and placebo in the other secondary outcome measures. The authors conclude that ketamine is associated with a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms at 24 hours and 72 hours after a single intravenous infusion. Ketamine may be a promising treatment for patients with PTSD who do not respond to other treatments.

Ketamine was also associated with a significant reduction in CAPS reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal subscale scores at 24 hours and 72 hours. The authors found no significant differences between ketamine and placebo in the other secondary outcome measures. The authors conclude that ketamine is associated with a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms at 24 hours and 72 hours after a single intravenous infusion. Ketamine may be a promising treatment for patients with PTSD who do not respond to other treatments.

OBJECTIVES: To study outcomes following opioid detoxification with ibogaine. METHODS: In this observational study, 30 subjects with DSM-IV Opioid Dependence (25 males, 5 females) received a mean total dose of 1,540 ± 920 mg ibogaine HCl. Subjects used oxycodone (n = 21; 70%) and/or heroin (n = 18; 60%) in respective amounts of 250 ± 180 mg/day and 1.3 ± 0.94 g/day, and averaged 3.1 ± 2.6 previous episodes of treatment for opioid dependence. Detoxification and follow-up outcomes at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were evaluated utilizing the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and Addiction Severity Index Composite (ASIC) scores, respectively. RESULTS: SOWS scores decreased from 31.0 ± 11.6 pretreatment to 14.0 ± 9.8 at 76.5 ± 30 hours posttreatment (t = 7.07, df = 26, p < 0.001).

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

2223,"Acute psychomotor effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-) administration over time in healthy volunteers.^\nIn Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'). The use of alcohol (ethanol) in combination with ecstasy is common. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute psychomotor and subjective effects of (co-) administration of MDMA and ethanol over time and in relation to the pharmacokinetics. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine men, seven women) between the ages of 18 and 29. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally while blood alcohol concentration was maintained at pseudo-steady state levels of approximately 0.6 per thousand for 3 h by a 10% intravenous ethanol clamp. MDMA significantly increased psychomotor speed but did not affect psychomotor accuracy and induced subjective arousal. Ethanol impaired both psychomotor speed and accuracy and induced sedation. Coadministration of ethanol and MDMA improved psychomotor speed but impaired psychomotor accuracy compared with placebo and reversed ethanol-induced sedation. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed maximal effects at 90-150 min after MDMA administration after which drug effects declined in spite of persisting MDMA plasma concentration, with the exception of ethanol-induced sedation, which manifested itself fully only after the infusion was stopped. In conclusion, results show that subjects were more aroused when intoxicated with both substances combined compared with placebo, but psychomotor accuracy was significantly impaired. These findings may have implications for general neuropsychological functioning as this may provide a sense of adequate performance that does not agree with a significant reduction in psychomotor accuracy.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Acute psychomotor effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-) administration over time in healthy volunteers.^\nIn Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'). The use of alcohol (ethanol) in combination with ecstasy is common. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute psychomotor and subjective effects of (co-) administration of MDMA and ethanol over time and in relation to the pharmacokinetics. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine men, seven women) between the ages of 18 and 29. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally while blood alcohol concentration was maintained at pseudo-steady state levels of approximately 0.6 per thousand for 3 h by a 10% intravenous ethanol clamp. MDMA significantly increased psychomotor speed but did not affect psychomotor accuracy and induced subjective arousal. Ethanol impaired both psychomotor speed and accuracy and induced sedation. Coadministration of ethanol and MDMA improved psychomotor speed but impaired psychomotor accuracy compared with placebo and reversed ethanol-induced sedation. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed maximal effects at 90-150 min after MDMA administration after which drug effects declined in spite of persisting MDMA plasma concentration, with the exception of ethanol-induced sedation, which manifested itself fully only after the infusion was stopped. In conclusion, results show that subjects were more aroused when intoxicated with both substances combined compared with placebo, but psychomotor accuracy was significantly impaired. These findings may have implications for general neuropsychological functioning as this may provide a sense of adequate performance that does not agree with a significant reduction in psychomotor accuracy.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention and response inhibition in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been shown to produce acute changes in mood and cognition. The present study investigated the effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention and response inhibition in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) and placebo in a random order. Sustained attention was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and response inhibition was assessed using the Stop Signal Task (SST). Psilocybin significantly impaired performance on the CPT, but not the SST. Methylphenidate significantly improved performance on the CPT, but not the SST. The results suggest that psilocybin and methylphenidate have opposing effects on sustained attention, but not response inhibition. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of psilocybin on mood and cognition.

INPUT: The effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the optimal dose of ketamine for the treatment of depression remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of low-dose ketamine on the treatment of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of low-dose ketamine with placebo in patients with depression. The primary outcome was the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score from baseline to the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the response rate and the remission rate. RESULTS: A total of 12 RCTs with 1,008 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in the HAMD score compared with placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.92 to -0.38, p < 0.001). The response rate was significantly higher in the low-dose ketamine group than in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.90, p < 0.001). The remission rate was also significantly higher in the low-dose ketamine group than in the placebo group (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.90, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine is effective in the treatment of depression. However, the optimal dose of ketamine for the treatment of depression remains unclear. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose of ketamine for the treatment of depression.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that is used as an anesthetic and analgesic agent. It has been reported that ketamine inhibits the metabolism of midazolam, a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in healthy volunteers. This study was conducted in 12 healthy male volunteers. The subjects received a single oral dose of 5 mg midazolam on day 1 and a single oral dose of 5 mg midazolam with 0.15 mg/kg ketamine on day 2. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after administration. The plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam was significantly increased by ketamine (P < 0.05). The AUC of 1-hydroxymidazolam was also significantly increased by ketamine (P < 0.05). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of midazolam was significantly increased by ketamine (P < 0.05).

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that is used as an anesthetic and analgesic agent. It has been reported that ketamine inhibits the metabolism of midazolam, a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in healthy volunteers. This study was conducted in 12 healthy male volunteers. The subjects received a single oral dose of 5 mg midazolam on day 1 and a single oral dose of 5 mg midazolam with 0.15 mg/kg ketamine on day 2. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after administration. The plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam was significantly increased by ketamine (P < 0.05). The AUC of 1-hydroxymidazolam was also significantly increased by ketamine (P < 0.05). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of midazolam was significantly increased by ketamine (P < 0.05).

This was the first clinical trial of noribogaine, ibogaine's active metabolite, in patients established on methadone opioid substitution therapy (OST). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending-dose study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of noribogaine in 27 patients seeking to discontinue methadone OST who had been switched to morphine during the previous week. Noribogaine doses were 60, 120, or 180 mg (n = 6/dose level) or matching placebo (n = 3/dose level). Noribogaine was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were noneuphoric changes in light perception ∼1 hour postdose, headache, and nausea. Noribogaine had dose-linear increases for AUC and C(max) and was slowly eliminated (mean t(1/2) range, 24-30 hours). There was a concentration-dependent increase in QTcI (0.17 ms/ng/mL), with the largest observed mean effect of ∼16, 28, and 42 milliseconds in the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg groups, respectively. Noribogaine showed a nonstatistically significant trend toward decreased total score in opioid withdrawal ratings, most notably at the 120-mg dose; however, the study design may have confounded evaluations of time to resumption of OST. Future exposure-controlled multiple-dose noribogaine studies are planned that will address these safety and design issues.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the effects of psilocybin on smoking cessation.^\nPsilocybin is a classic psychedelic that has been shown to produce profound and enduring changes in mood, cognition, and behavior. In this study, we examined the effects of psilocybin on smoking cessation. Thirty-two smokers were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (10 mg/70 kg) or placebo in a crossover design. Participants were instructed to abstain from smoking for 1 week after each session. The primary outcome was point prevalence abstinence at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included continuous abstinence, time to first cigarette, and withdrawal symptoms. Psilocybin produced a large and significant increase in the point prevalence abstinence rate at 6 months (p =.01). The 6-month point prevalence abstinence rate was 67% (12 of 18) after psilocybin and 9% (2 of 22) after placebo. The 6-month continuous abstinence rate was 39% (7 of 18) after psilocybin and 0% (0 of 22) after placebo. The median time to first cigarette was 8 days after psilocybin and 0.5 days after placebo.

The search was limited to English-language articles published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019. The search terms used were ""psilocybin,"" ""cognition,"" and ""mood."" The search yielded 1,012 articles, of which 10 were included in the final analysis. The included studies were randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case reports. The studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and in patients with depression or anxiety. The studies assessed the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood using a variety of measures, including the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The results of the included studies were mixed. Some studies found that psilocybin had beneficial effects on cognition and mood, while others found no significant effects. The studies that found beneficial effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood were generally of higher quality than the studies that found no significant effects. The results of this systematic review suggest that psilocybin may have beneficial effects on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. However, the evidence is mixed, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.

4578,"Interactive effects of subanesthetic ketamine and subhypnotic lorazepam in humans.^\nKetamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with psychotogenic and dissociative effects in healthy humans. These cognitive and perceptual effects in humans are reportedly reduced by benzodiazepine premedication. This study assessed the interactive effects of a ketamine (i.v. bolus of 0.26 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.65 mg/kg per hour) and lorazepam 2 mg., PO, in humans. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed 4 test days involving the oral administration of lorazepam or matched placebo 2 h prior to the i.v. infusion of ketamine or placebo. Ketamine: 1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); 2) evoked perceptual alterations as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS); 3) impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and other tests sensitive to frontal cortical impairment; and 4) had amnestic effects. Lorazepam produced attention impairments, concrete proverb interpretations, and recall impairments. Lorazepam reduced ketamine-associated emotional distress and there was a non-significant trend for it to decrease perceptual alterations produced by ketamine. However, it failed to reduce many cognitive and behavioral effects of ketamine, including psychosis. Further, lorazepam exacerbated the sedative, attention-impairing, and amnestic effects of ketamine. There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between these medications. These data suggest that subhypnotic lorazepam and ketamine show a spectrum of interactive effects, ranging from antagonism to potentiation.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on ""default mode network"" connectivity.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivated during goal-directed tasks. The DMN has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. The authors used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on DMN connectivity in 20 healthy volunteers. Ketamine produced a dose-dependent increase in DMN connectivity, with the greatest effects observed at the highest dose (0.5 mg/kg). The authors also found that the magnitude of the increase in DMN connectivity was correlated with the magnitude of the increase in positive mood. These findings suggest that ketamine may exert its antidepressant effects by increasing DMN connectivity. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the pathophysiology of depression and for the development of novel antidepressant treatments.

4632,"The novel psychoactive phenetylamine 4-fluoroamphetamine produces a mild psychedelic state without affecting creative thinking.^\nThe phenetylamine 4‐fluoroamphetamine (4‐FA) is a so‐called novel psychoactive substance with a chemical structure that resembles that of amphetamine and MDMA [1]. Since 4‐FA users report the subjective experience to range between that induced by amphetamine and MDMA, and it is known both substances can produce an altered state of consciousness, it will be tested whether 4‐FA induces a similar state. In addition, dissociative states have been linked with increased creativity or creative thinking [2]. In light of the renewed interest in psychedelics as therapeutic tools in the treatment of psychopathologies like depression and anxiety disorders, where rigid thinking is one of the hallmarks, it is important to test whether this new compound can induce flexible thinking. A placebo‐controlled 2‐way crossover study in twelve healthy poly‐drug users was conducted to test subjective and behavioral effects of 4‐FA (100 mg). The 100 mg dose was based on a user survey amongst Dutch 4‐FA users. The majority of the users who knew which dose they ingest typically indicated it to be between 50‐150 mg [1]. Subjective effects were tested by means of the Bowdle Visual Analogue Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale and the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale. Convergent and divergent thinking was assessed by means of the Picture Concept test (PCT). Both subjective and objective measures have previously been shown to be sensitive to the effects of stimulants and/or psychedelic substances [3,4]. Measurements took place 1‐to‐11 hours post‐administration. 4‐FA concentrations were determined in serum up to 12 hours after administration. Findings showed that 4‐FA induced a psychedelic state which was highest 1 hour after 4‐FA administration, around 4‐FA peak serum concentrations. The 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state decreased over time. There was no effect of 4‐FA on creative thinking. While the hypothesis that 4‐FA would induce a psychedelic state that can be categorized in between that produced by amphetamine and MDMA was confirmed, the hypothesized effect on divergent thinking could not be confirmed. Although not statistically significant, it was interesting to see that convergent thinking was increased 6 hours after intake compared to placebo, while divergent thinking performance was placebo‐like. This pattern is opposite to the previously demonstrated ayahuasca effect where two hours after intake convergent thinking was decreased by 15% compared to baseline and divergent thinking was increased by approximately 20% [4]. To confirm the absence or presence of 4‐FA effects on creative thinking, future research needs to include creative performance tests at different time points in the serum curve. In addition, creative thinking should then also be assessed in proximity with the peak of dissociative effects to test whether both are associated as suggested by previous studies linking dissociative states and creativity [3]. It is concluded that while the 4‐FA‐induced psychedelic state is mild in intensity and in between that of amphetamine and MDMA as hypothesized, more research is needed to (in) validate whether 4‐FA can change creative thinking.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual rituals and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to systematically and critically evaluate the neuropsychological and neuroimaging literature on psilocybin. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to studies published in English between 1960 and 2016. The search yielded 1,014 articles, of which 21 were included in the review. The majority of the studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and used a within-subjects design. The most common neuropsychological measures were the Stroop task and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The most common neuroimaging measures were functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies reporting significant effects of psilocybin on neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures and others reporting no effects. The mixed results may be due to differences in study design, including the dose of psilocybin administered, the duration of the study, and the neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures used. Overall, the results of the studies suggest that psilocybin may have some effects on neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures, but more research is needed to determine the specific effects of psilocybin on the brain.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual rituals and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to systematically and critically evaluate the neuropsychological and neuroimaging literature on psilocybin. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to studies published in English between 1960 and 2016. The search yielded 1,014 articles, of which 21 were included in the review. The majority of the studies were conducted in healthy volunteers and used a within-subjects design. The most common neuropsychological measures were the Stroop task and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The most common neuroimaging measures were functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies reporting significant effects of psilocybin on neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures and others reporting no effects. The mixed results may be due to differences in study design, including the dose of psilocybin administered, the duration of the study, and the neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures used. Overall, the results of the studies suggest that psilocybin may have some effects on neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures, but more research is needed to determine the specific effects of psilocybin on the brain.

4639,"Acute dose of MDMA (75 mg) impairs spatial memory for location but leaves contextual processing of visuospatial information unaffected.^\nRATIONALE: Research concerning spatial memory in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users has presented conflicting results showing either the presence or absence of spatial memory deficits. Two factors may have confounded results in abstinent users: memory task characteristics and polydrug use. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to assess whether a single dose of MDMA affects spatial memory performance during intoxication and withdrawal phase and whether spatial memory performance after MDMA is task dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design. They were treated with placebo, MDMA 75 mg, and methylphenidate 20 mg. Memory tests were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h (intoxication phase) and between 25.5 and 26 h (withdrawal phase) post-dosing. Two spatial memory tasks of varying complexity were used that required either storage of stimulus location alone (spatial memory task) or memory for location as well as processing of content or contextual information (change blindness task). RESULTS: After a single dose of MDMA, the subjects made larger localization errors and responded faster compared to placebo in the simple spatial memory task during intoxication phase. Inaccuracy was not due to increased response speed, as determined by regression analysis. Performance in the change blindness task was not affected by MDMA. Methylphenidate did not affect performance on any of the tasks. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a single dose of MDMA impairs spatial memory for location but leaves processing of contextual information intact.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

This period may offer a window of increased therapeutic potential. Objective: To explore changes in mindfulness and cognitive flexibility before and within 24 h after ayahuasca use. Methods: Forty-eight participants (54% female) were assessed on measures of mindfulness (Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)), and cognitive flexibility (Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS)), and completed the Stroop and Wisconsin Picture Card Sorting Task (WPCST) before drinking ayahuasca, and again within 24 h. Results: Mindfulness (FFMQ total scores and four of the five mindfulness facets: observe, describe, act with awareness, and non-reactivity) and decentering (EQ) significantly increased in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Cognitive flexibility (CFS and WPCST) significantly improved in the 24 h after ayahuasca use. Changes in both mindfulness and cognitive flexibility were not influenced by prior ayahuasca use.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual rituals and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We included studies that used neuropsychological tests or neuroimaging techniques to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We excluded studies that did not report the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies (n = 24) used neuroimaging techniques to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the brain. The most commonly used neuroimaging technique was functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 16). The most commonly investigated brain regions were the default mode network (n = 10) and the amygdala (n = 9). The most commonly investigated neuropsychological domains were emotion (n = 6) and cognition (n = 5). The most commonly investigated neuropsychological tests were the Stroop task (n = 4) and the Iowa Gambling Task (n = 3). The most commonly reported effects of psilocybin on the brain were increased activity in the default mode network (n = 10) and decreased activity in the amygdala (n = 9). The most commonly reported neuropsychological effects of psilocybin were improved emotion regulation (n = 6) and improved cognitive flexibility (n = 5). The most commonly reported neuropsychological tests that were sensitive to the effects of psilocybin were the Stroop task (n = 4) and the Iowa Gambling Task (n = 3). The most commonly reported neuropsychological tests that were insensitive to the effects of psilocybin were the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (n = 3) and the Trail Making Test (n = 2).

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^\nPsilocybin is a classic psychedelic with a long history of use in the treatment of depression. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in patients with treatment-resistant depression. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 59 patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (0.15 mg/kg) or placebo in two treatment sessions, 7 days apart. The primary outcome was the change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score from baseline to 1 week after the second treatment session. Secondary outcomes included the change in HDRS-17 score from baseline to 1 week after the first treatment session, the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 1 week after the second treatment session, and the change in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) score from baseline to 1 week after the second treatment session. The HDRS-17 score decreased significantly more in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group at 1 week after the second treatment session (mean difference, -8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -10.2 to -6.0; P < 0.001). The HDRS-17 score decreased significantly more in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group at 1 week after the first treatment session (mean difference, -6.4; 95% CI, -8.8 to -4.0; P < 0.001). The MADRS score decreased significantly more in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group at 1 week after the second treatment session (mean difference, -7.3; 95% CI, -9.5 to -5.1; P < 0.001).

6698,"The effects of ketamine on typical and atypical depressive symptoms.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine's effects on different dimensions of depressive symptomatology, including typical/melancholic and atypical depression, remain largely unknown. This study examined the effects of a single intravenous dose of ketamine on general depressive symptoms (measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), typical/melancholic symptoms (measured using the MADRS5), and atypical symptoms (measured using the Scale for Atypical Symptoms (SAS)). METHODS: Data from 68 participants with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression were pooled from three separate, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies investigating ketamine's efficacy in depression. MDD participants were unmedicated; bipolar participants received therapeutic-dose lithium or valproate. Clinical symptoms were collected preinfusion and up to 14 days postinfusion. Effect sizes were calculated for days 1 and 3 postinfusion. The primary measures of interest for this exploratory analysis were total MADRS, MADRS5, and SAS scores. Individual symptoms were also analyzed in an exploratory manner. RESULTS: Scores improved significantly at Day 1 postinfusion (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.64; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.61; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.41) and continued to be significantly improved over placebo at Day 3 (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.49; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.43; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.39).

RESULTS: Scores improved significantly at Day 1 postinfusion (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.64; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.61; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.41) and continued to be significantly improved over placebo at Day 3 (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.49; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.43; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.39). Effect sizes were greater for typical/melancholic than atypical symptoms at Day 1 postinfusion. CONCLUSION: Ketamine appears to effectively treat both the typical/melancholic and atypical symptoms of depression, but may have early preferential effects for the former.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on typical and atypical depressive symptoms.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine's effects on different dimensions of depressive symptomatology, including typical/melancholic and atypical depression, remain largely unknown. This study examined the effects of a single intravenous dose of ketamine on general depressive symptoms (measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), typical/melancholic symptoms (measured using the MADRS5), and atypical symptoms (measured using the Scale for Atypical Symptoms (SAS)). METHODS: Data from 68 participants with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression were pooled from three separate, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies investigating ketamine's efficacy in depression. MDD participants were unmedicated; bipolar participants received therapeutic-dose lithium or valproate. Clinical symptoms were collected preinfusion and up to 14 days postinfusion. Effect sizes were calculated for days 1 and 3 postinfusion. The primary measures of interest for this exploratory analysis were total MADRS, MADRS5, and SAS scores. Individual symptoms were also analyzed in an exploratory manner. RESULTS: Scores improved significantly at Day 1 postinfusion (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.64; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.61; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.41) and continued to be significantly improved over placebo at Day 3 (MADRS: Cohen's d = 0.49; MADRS5: Cohen's d = 0.43; SAS: Cohen's d = 0.39).

7455,"The effects of psilocybin and MDMA on between-network resting state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers.^\nPerturbing a system and observing the consequences is a classic scientific strategy for understanding a phenomenon. Psychedelic drugs perturb consciousness in a marked and novel way and thus are powerful tools for studying its mechanisms. In the present analysis, we measured changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between a standard template of different independent components analysis (ICA)-derived resting state networks (RSNs) under the influence of two different psychoactive drugs, the stimulant/psychedelic hybrid, MDMA, and the classic psychedelic, psilocybin.

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

8052,"A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Frequency Study of Intravenous Ketamine in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated a rapid-onset antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression. This study evaluated the efficacy of twice- and thrice-weekly intravenous administration of ketamine in sustaining initial antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: In a multicenter, double-blind study, adults (ages 18-64 years) with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) or intravenous placebo, administered over 40 minutes, either two or three times weekly, for up to 4 weeks. Patients who discontinued double-blind treatment after at least 2 weeks for lack of efficacy could enter an optional 2-week open-label phase to receive ketamine with the same frequency as in the double-blind phase. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to day 15 in total score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: In total, 67 (45 women) of 68 randomized patients received treatment. In the twice-weekly dosing groups, the mean change in MADRS score at day 15 was -18.4 (SD=12.0) for ketamine and -5.7 (SD=10.2) for placebo; in the thrice-weekly groups, it was -17.7 (SD=7.3) for ketamine and -3.1 (SD=5.7) for placebo.

8413,"Baseline neural response during the processing of emotional faces predicts antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nBackground: Emotional processing biases in major depressive disorder(MDD) may be associated with altered neural processing in visual cortical regions. Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects. Here we correlated antidepressant response to ketamine with baseline neural response to emotional faces when judging emotion and gender. Methods: Ten unmedicated depressed MDD patients(3 males) participated in an FMRI study. Identical emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender. Subjects then participated in a placebo‐controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine(.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed repeatedly using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Multiple regression estimated BOLD response when judging emotion (positive/ negative) and when judging gender (positive/negative). BOLD response (4 conditions) was correlated with treatment outcome(percent change in MADRS). Significance defined as voxel p<0.005; whole brain corrected. Results: BOLD response correlated positively with treatment response when judging negative emotion bilaterally in middle occipital cortex(MOC) and in left parahippocampal gyrus; and correlated positively when judging positive emotion in an overlapping region of left MOC. When judging gender and emotion was positive, a positive correlation was observed in a more dorsal, non‐overlapping region of left MOC. Conclusions: Neural activity in bilateral MOC when judging negative emotion correlated with subsequent treatment response to ketamine, regions previously found to predict treatment response to another rapid antidepressant (scopolamine). The patterns of neural response in visual cortex to specific emotion processing conditions in MDD may provide a biomarker of treatment response to multiple rapid antidepressant agents.","***TASK***

However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325).

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that is often refractory to treatment. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for PTSD. METHOD: Patients with PTSD (N = 45) were randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the CAPS total score at 1 week and 1 month after infusion, the CAPS total score at 24 hours after infusion, and the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. RESULTS: The mean CAPS total score decreased significantly more in the ketamine group than in the placebo group at 24 hours after infusion (mean difference = 13.5, 95% CI = 4.2-22.8, p =.005). The mean CAPS total score decreased significantly more in the ketamine group than in the placebo group at 1 week after infusion (mean difference = 11.8, 95% CI = 2.2-21.4, p =.017). The mean CAPS total score decreased significantly more in the ketamine group than in the placebo group at 1 month after infusion (mean difference = 11.2, 95% CI = 1.6-20.8, p =.023). The mean MADRS total score decreased significantly more in the ketamine group than in the placebo group at 24 hours after infusion (mean difference = 8.8, 95% CI = 1.5-16.1, p =.018). CONCLUSIONS: A single infusion of ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms at 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after infusion.

9277,"Low-dose ketamine does not improve the speed of recovery from depression in electroconvulsive therapy: a randomized controlled trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder. Recent literature has shown that the anesthetic agent ketamine has some antidepressant properties at low doses and may be an alternative therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. We hypothesized that the use of low-dose ketamine as an anesthetic adjunct in ECT would more rapidly improve depression while maintaining hemodynamic stability than ECT with propofol alone. METHODS: Institutional ethics approval was obtained, and the use of ketamine in this study was approved by Health Canada. This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that involved ketamine administration at 0.5 mg/kg IV in addition to propofol anesthesia for ECT. The primary outcome was the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 50% reduction in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes included the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 25% reduction in MADRS score, as well as any differences in the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity, hemodynamic variables, and seizure duration. Adverse events were recorded for safety assessment. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients completed the study. No difference was found between groups with respect to the primary or secondary outcomes. The ketamine group showed a trend towards a decreased dose of propofol required to achieve adequate anesthesia. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine does not improve psychiatric outcomes in the setting of propofol-based anesthesia for ECT. Specifically, ketamine did not reduce the number of ECT sessions necessary to achieve a 50 or 25% reduction in MADRS scores.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activity during the presentation of emotional faces. The results showed that ketamine significantly increased the activity of the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to fearful faces. There was also a significant increase in the activity of the ACC in response to happy faces. These findings suggest that a single dose of ketamine modulates the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. The results of this study provide further evidence that ketamine may have antidepressant effects by modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

612,"MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies for thousands of years and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 10 mg psilocybin or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the intensity of the psychedelic experience, as measured by the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale. Secondary outcome measures included the intensity of the subjective effects of psilocybin, as measured by the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS), and the effects of psilocybin on mood, as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The 5D-ASC scale was significantly higher in the psilocybin condition than in the placebo condition, indicating that psilocybin produced a more intense psychedelic experience. The HRS was also significantly higher in the psilocybin condition than in the placebo condition, indicating that psilocybin produced a more intense subjective experience. The POMS was significantly lower in the psilocybin condition than in the placebo condition, indicating that psilocybin produced a more positive mood. These results suggest that a single dose of psilocybin can produce a powerful psychedelic experience in healthy volunteers. The effects of psilocybin on mood were also positive, suggesting that it may have potential as a treatment for psychiatric disorders.

698,"Ketanserin Reverses the Acute Response to LSD in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study in Healthy Participants.^\nBACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is currently being investigated in psychedelic-assisted therapy. LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8-11 hours. It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (HT2A) receptor. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD. However, unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD. METHODS: We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 24 healthy participants who underwent two 14-hour sessions and received ketanserin (40 mg p.o.) or placebo 1 hour after LSD (100 µg p.o.). Outcome measures included subjective effects, autonomic effects, acute adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD, thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5 hours with placebo to 3.5 hours. Ketanserin also reversed LSD-induced alterations of mind, including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution. Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5-HT2A receptors. Ketanserin can effectively be used as a planned or rescue option to shorten and attenuate the LSD experience in humans in research and LSD-assisted therapy.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound that has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual rituals. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in psilocybin as a potential treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We conducted a systematic search of the literature using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. We included studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on the brain using neuropsychological or neuroimaging methods. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (n = 24) used neuroimaging methods, while the remaining studies (n = 8) used neuropsychological methods. The most common neuroimaging method was functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which was used in 18 studies. The most common neuropsychological method was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which was used in 5 studies. The results of the included studies suggest that psilocybin has a wide range of effects on the brain. The most consistent finding was an increase in brain activity in the default mode network (DMN). Other common findings included an increase in brain activity in the salience network and a decrease in brain activity in the executive control network. The results of the included studies also suggest that the effects of psilocybin on the brain are dose-dependent.

791,"Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.","***TASK***

However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine that is found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has been used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy volunteers were given a single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) and were assessed for 8 h. The effects of psilocybin were compared with those of a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. Psilocybin produced a dose-related increase in plasma prolactin levels, which was blocked by ketanserin. Psilocybin also produced a dose-related increase in heart rate, which was blocked by ketanserin. Psilocybin produced a dose-related increase in blood pressure, which was not blocked by ketanserin. Psilocybin produced a dose-related increase in subjective ratings of ""good drug effect"" and ""bad drug effect"".

1443,"Happiness During Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion Predicts Treatment Response: Reexploring the Adjunctive Ketamine Study of Taiwanese Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Studies have reported that ketamine potentially increases subjective happiness in healthy volunteers. However, whether ketamine-induced happiness can predict the treatment response of ketamine infusion among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unknown. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 71 adult patients with TRD (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute ketamine (0.5 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg) or normal saline placebo infusion. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Measurements were conducted prior to infusion, at 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion, and, sequentially, on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion. The visual analog scale for happiness (VASH) was used to assess happiness during infusion. The positive symptoms subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-P) was used to measure the potential psychotomimetic effects of ketamine. RESULTS: For both the 2-factor (ketamine vs placebo) and 3-factor (ketamine 0.5 mg/kg vs 0.2 mg/kg vs placebo) models, a generalized estimating equation model indicated that infusion response type (happiness vs nonhappiness) significantly (P = .008 vs P = .002) predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms after infusion. Changes in VASH and BPRS-P measures were not associated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion over time.

CONCLUSIONS: Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion over time. Happiness during ketamine infusion, which was not related to the psychotomimetic effect of ketamine, may be associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow-up.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in obsessive-compulsive disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). METHOD: Twenty-four patients with OCD were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score at 24 hours. Secondary outcome measures included the Y-BOCS score at 1 week, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score at 24 hours, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score at 24 hours. RESULTS: The mean Y-BOCS score at 24 hours was 21.3 (SD = 5.3) in the ketamine group and 21.8 (SD = 5.2) in the placebo group (p =.84). The mean Y-BOCS score at 1 week was 21.3 (SD = 5.3) in the ketamine group and 21.8 (SD = 5.2) in the placebo group (p =.84). The mean HAM-D score at 24 hours was 14.3 (SD = 5.3) in the ketamine group and 14.8 (SD = 5.2) in the placebo group (p =.84). The mean CGI-S score at 24 hours was 3.3 (SD = 0.8) in the ketamine group and 3.4 (SD = 0.8) in the placebo group (p =.84). CONCLUSIONS: A single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) did not produce a significant improvement in OCD symptoms at 24 hours or 1 week. The results of this study do not support the use of ketamine in the treatment of OCD.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers: a systematic review.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used in the treatment of depression and anxiety, and has been shown to have beneficial effects on cognition. However, the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers are not well understood. This systematic review aims to summarize the current evidence on the effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to English-language articles published between 2000 and 2019. The search terms used were ""psilocybin"", ""cognition"", and ""mood"". The search yielded 12 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case reports. The majority of the studies were conducted in healthy volunteers. The results of the included studies suggest that psilocybin has beneficial effects on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers. However, the evidence is limited by the small sample sizes and the short duration of the studies. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of the included studies and to investigate the long-term effects of psilocybin on cognition and mood in healthy volunteers.

1864,"Psychedelic Treatment for Trauma-Related Psychological and Cognitive Impairment Among US Special Operations Forces Veterans.^\nBACKGROUND: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans are at increased risk for a variety of mental health problems and cognitive impairment associated with military service. Current treatments are lacking in effectiveness and adherence. Therefore, this study examined psychedelic treatment with ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine for trauma-related psychological and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. METHOD: We conducted a survey of Veterans who completed a specific psychedelic clinical program in Mexico between 2017 and 2019. Questions probed retrospective reports of mental health and cognitive functioning during the 30 days before and 30 days after treatment. A total of 65 people completed treatment during this time frame and were eligible for contact. Of these, 51 (78%) completed the survey and were included in data analyses (mean age = 40; male = 96%; married = 55%; Caucasian/White = 92%; Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Service = 96%). RESULTS: Results indicated significant and very large reductions in retrospective report of suicidal ideation (p < .001; d = -1.9), cognitive impairment (p < .001; d = -2.8), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .001; d = -3.6), depression (p < .001; d = -3.7), and anxiety (p < .001; d = -3.1). Results also showed a significant and large increase in retrospective report of psychological flexibility (p < .001; d = 2.9) from before-to-after the psychedelic treatment. Increases in the retrospective report of psychological flexibility were strongly associated with retrospective report of reductions in cognitive impairment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (rs range -0.61 to -0.75; p < .001). Additionally, most participants rated the psychedelic experiences as one of the top five personally meaningful (84%), spiritually significant (88%), and psychologically insightful (86%) experiences of their lives.Limitations: Several limitations should be considered including the retrospective, self-report, survey design of the study, and the lack of randomization and blinding, thus making these finding preliminary. CONCLUSION: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans may have unique treatment needs because of the sequela of problems associated with repeated trauma exposure and the nature of the exposure. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with these under-researched psychedelics may hold unique promise for this population. However, controlled studies are needed to determine whether this treatment is efficacious in relieving mental health and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans.","***TASK***

In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Psychedelic Treatment for Trauma-Related Psychological and Cognitive Impairment Among US Special Operations Forces Veterans.^\nBACKGROUND: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans are at increased risk for a variety of mental health problems and cognitive impairment associated with military service. Current treatments are lacking in effectiveness and adherence. Therefore, this study examined psychedelic treatment with ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine for trauma-related psychological and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. METHOD: We conducted a survey of Veterans who completed a specific psychedelic clinical program in Mexico between 2017 and 2019. Questions probed retrospective reports of mental health and cognitive functioning during the 30 days before and 30 days after treatment. A total of 65 people completed treatment during this time frame and were eligible for contact. Of these, 51 (78%) completed the survey and were included in data analyses (mean age = 40; male = 96%; married = 55%; Caucasian/White = 92%; Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Service = 96%). RESULTS: Results indicated significant and very large reductions in retrospective report of suicidal ideation (p < .001; d = -1.9), cognitive impairment (p < .001; d = -2.8), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .001; d = -3.6), depression (p < .001; d = -3.7), and anxiety (p < .001; d = -3.1). Results also showed a significant and large increase in retrospective report of psychological flexibility (p < .001; d = 2.9) from before-to-after the psychedelic treatment. Increases in the retrospective report of psychological flexibility were strongly associated with retrospective report of reductions in cognitive impairment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (rs range -0.61 to -0.75; p < .001). Additionally, most participants rated the psychedelic experiences as one of the top five personally meaningful (84%), spiritually significant (88%), and psychologically insightful (86%) experiences of their lives.Limitations: Several limitations should be considered including the retrospective, self-report, survey design of the study, and the lack of randomization and blinding, thus making these finding preliminary. CONCLUSION: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans may have unique treatment needs because of the sequela of problems associated with repeated trauma exposure and the nature of the exposure. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with these under-researched psychedelics may hold unique promise for this population. However, controlled studies are needed to determine whether this treatment is efficacious in relieving mental health and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual rituals and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We conducted a systematic search of the literature in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. We included studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on the brain using neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. We identified 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The results of these studies suggest that psilocybin has a wide range of effects on the brain, including changes in brain activity, connectivity, and structure. These effects are likely to be mediated by the activation of serotonin receptors. The results of this review suggest that psilocybin has a wide range of effects on the brain. These effects are likely to be mediated by the activation of serotonin receptors. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of psilocybin on the brain and to determine the potential therapeutic applications of this compound.

1966,"Effectiveness of a neuroscience-based, harm reduction program for older adolescents: A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Illicit Project.^\nThe prevention of risky adolescent substance use is critical. Limited age-appropriate, school-based programs target adolescents aged 16-19 years, despite this representing the age of initiation and escalation of substance use. The Illicit Project is a neuroscience-based, harm reduction program targeting late adolescents, designed to address this gap. The current study aims to evaluate the program's effectiveness in reducing risky substance use and related harms among late adolescents. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted involving 950 students (M(age) = 15.9 years SD = 0.68; 60% Female) from eight secondary schools in Australia. Five schools received The Illicit Project program, and three schools were randomised into the active control group (health education as usual). All students completed a self-report survey at baseline and 6-months post-baseline and intervention students completed a program evaluation survey. Outcomes include alcohol and substance use, alcohol related harms and drug literacy levels (knowledge and skills). At 6-months post baseline, individuals in the intervention group were less likely to engage in weekly binge drinking (OR = 0.56), high monthly alcohol consumption (OR = 0.56), early onset cannabis use (OR = 0.35), risky single occasion cannabis use (OR = 0.48), MDMA use (OR = 0.16) or nicotine product use (OR = 0.59) compared to the control group. Students in the intervention group were less likely to have experience alcohol related harms (OR = 0.57) and more likely to have higher drug literacy scores (β = 2.44) at follow-up.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the brain: a systematic review of the literature.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anesthetic for over 50 years. In recent years, ketamine has been used as a treatment for depression, and has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects. The aim of this review was to examine the effects of ketamine on the brain, and to determine whether ketamine has any potential as a treatment for depression.

2207,"Long term structural and functional neural changes following a single infusion of Ketamine in PTSD.^\nNMDA receptor antagonists have a vital role in extinction, learning, and reconsolidation processes. During the reconsolidation window, memories are activated into a labile state and can be reconsolidated in an altered form. This concept might have significant clinical implications in treating PTSD. In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine, followed by brief exposure therapy, to enhance post-retrieval extinction of PTSD trauma memories. 27 individuals diagnosed with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg 40 min; N = 14) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg; N = 13) after retrieval of the traumatic memory. 24 h following infusion, participants received a four-day trauma-focused psychotherapy. Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up. Amygdala activation to trauma scripts (a major biomarker of fear response) served as the main study outcome. Although PTSD symptoms improved equally in both groups, post-treatment, ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala (-0.33, sd = 0.13, 95%HDI [-0.56,-0.04]) and hippocampus (-0.3 (sd = 0.19), 95%HDI [-0.65, 0.04]; marginal effect) reactivation to trauma memories, compared to midazolam recipients. Post-retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (-0.28, sd = 0.11, 95%HDI [-0.46, -0.11]), with no change in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Moreover, reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi-lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients (right: post-treatment: -0.01108, 95% HDI [-0.0184,-0.003]; follow-up: -0.0183, 95% HDI [-0.02719,-0.0107]; left: post-treatment: -0.019, 95% HDI [-0.028,-0.011]; follow-up: -0.017, 95% HDI [-0.026,-0.007]). Taken together it is possible that ketamine may enhance post-retrieval extinction of the original trauma memories in humans. These preliminary findings show promising direction toward the capacity to rewrite human traumatic memories and modulate the fear response for at least 30 days post-extinction. When combined with psychotherapy for PTSD, further investigation of ketamine dose, timing of administration, and frequency of administration, is warranted.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 10 mg psilocybin or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the effects of psilocybin on mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. Secondary outcome measures included the effects of psilocybin on cognitive function, subjective experience, and physiological measures. Psilocybin produced a rapid onset of effects, with peak effects occurring 90 min after administration. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive mood, a significant decrease in negative mood, and a significant increase in anxiety. There were no significant changes in psychotic symptoms. Psilocybin produced a significant decrease in performance on a test of executive function, but no significant changes in performance on tests of attention, memory, or working memory. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in subjective experience, including a significant increase in the intensity of the psychedelic experience. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in heart rate and a significant decrease in blood pressure. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in the intensity of the psychedelic experience, but no significant changes in mood, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms.

However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning.

This article describes a retrospective review of 21 Ss (aged 29–81 yrs) with chronic neuropathic pain who were treated with oral ketamine as an adjunct to ongoing therapy with individualized combinations of opioids, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Ss were treated with oral ketamine starting at a divided dose of 100 mg/day and titrating upwards by 40 mg/day until efficacy was reached, or until side effects became limiting. A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and side effects of the treatment. Nine Ss discontinued ketamine because of intolerable side effects, 4 Ss experienced few or no side effects but had no discernible benefit, 4 others had equivocal responses. Four Ss had continued oral ketamine for long periods. One patient has had no significant benefit or side effects but continues to use ketamine 500 mg/day and 3 people used doses ranging from 100–240 mg day for over 1 year duration and have reported improvements in pain and decreased use of analgesics. The analgesic benefits of ketamine appeared to be most pronounced in, but not limited to, patients with pain histories of less than 5 years.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Clinical experience with oral ketamine.^\nKetamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used for analgesia in patients with chronic pain. This article describes a retrospective review of 21 Ss (aged 29–81 yrs) with chronic neuropathic pain who were treated with oral ketamine as an adjunct to ongoing therapy with individualized combinations of opioids, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Ss were treated with oral ketamine starting at a divided dose of 100 mg/day and titrating upwards by 40 mg/day until efficacy was reached, or until side effects became limiting. A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and side effects of the treatment. Nine Ss discontinued ketamine because of intolerable side effects, 4 Ss experienced few or no side effects but had no discernible benefit, 4 others had equivocal responses. Four Ss had continued oral ketamine for long periods. One patient has had no significant benefit or side effects but continues to use ketamine 500 mg/day and 3 people used doses ranging from 100–240 mg day for over 1 year duration and have reported improvements in pain and decreased use of analgesics. The analgesic benefits of ketamine appeared to be most pronounced in, but not limited to, patients with pain histories of less than 5 years.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its metabolites in healthy volunteers.^\nThe effects of ketamine on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its metabolites were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. The subjects received a single oral dose of midazolam (7.5 mg) on two occasions, 1 week apart. On one occasion, the subjects received ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) intravenously 5 min before midazolam. On the other occasion, the subjects received placebo intravenously 5 min before midazolam. The plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam and its metabolites were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam was significantly increased by ketamine (P = 0.0001). The AUC of 1-hydroxymidazolam was also significantly increased by ketamine (P = 0.0001). The AUC of 4-hydroxymidazolam was not significantly changed by ketamine. The AUC of 1-hydroxymidazolam was significantly correlated with the AUC of midazolam (r = 0.81, P = 0.0001). The AUC of 4-hydroxymidazolam was not correlated with the AUC of midazolam. The results suggest that ketamine increases the bioavailability of midazolam by inhibiting the metabolism of midazolam to 1-hydroxymidazolam.

2800,"Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^\nObjectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: a systematic and critical review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual rituals and has recently been investigated for its therapeutic potential. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of psilocybin on the brain. We conducted a systematic search of the literature in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. We included studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on the brain using neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. We identified 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The results of these studies suggest that psilocybin can induce a range of effects on the brain, including changes in brain activity, connectivity, and structure. These effects are thought to be mediated by the activation of serotonin receptors. Psilocybin has also been shown to have therapeutic potential for a range of conditions, including depression, anxiety, and addiction. However, further research is needed to fully understand the effects of psilocybin on the brain and its therapeutic potential.

METHODS: Prolactin response to d-fenfluramine was assessed in abstinent ecstasy users with concomitant use of cannabis only (n = 24, male/female 13/11) and in two control groups: healthy nonusers (n = 13, female) and exclusive cannabis users (n = 7, male). RESULTS: Prolactin response to d-fenfluramine was slightly blunted in female ecstasy users. Both male user samples exhibited a weak prolactin response to d-fenfluramine, but this was weaker in the group of cannabis users. Baseline prolactin and prolactin response to d-fenfluramine were associated with the extent of previous cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrinological abnormalities of ecstasy users may be closely related to their coincident cannabis use. Cannabis use may be an important confound in endocrinological studies of ecstasy users and should be looked for more systematically in future studies.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters.

3283,"Prospective memory functioning among ecstasy/polydrug users: Evidence from the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT).^\nRationale Prospective memory (PM) deficits in recreational drug users have been documented in recent years. However, the assessment of PM has largely been restricted to selfreported measures that fail to capture the distinction between event-based and time-based PM. The aim of the present study is to address this limitation. Objectives Extending our previous research, we augmented the range laboratory measures of PM by employing the CAMPROMPT test battery to investigate the impact of illicit drug use on prospective remembering in a sample of cannabis only, ecstasy/polydrug and non-users of illicit drugs, separating event and time-based PM performance. We also administered measures of executive function and retrospective memory in order to establish whether ecstasy/polydrug deficits in PM were mediated by group differences in these processes. Results Ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on both event and time-based prospective memory tasks in comparison to both cannabis only and non-user groups. Furthermore, it was found that across the whole sample, better retrospective memory and executive functioning was associated with superior PM performance. Nevertheless, this association did not mediate the drug-related effects that were observed. Consistent with our previous study, recreational use of cocaine was linked to PM deficits. Conclusions PM deficits have again been found among ecstasy/polydrug users, which appear to be unrelated to group differences in executive function and retrospective memory. However, the possibility that these are attributable to cocaine use cannot be excluded. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Prospective memory functioning among ecstasy/polydrug users: Evidence from the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (CAMPROMPT).^\nRationale Prospective memory (PM) deficits in recreational drug users have been documented in recent years. However, the assessment of PM has largely been restricted to selfreported measures that fail to capture the distinction between event-based and time-based PM. The aim of the present study is to address this limitation. Objectives Extending our previous research, we augmented the range laboratory measures of PM by employing the CAMPROMPT test battery to investigate the impact of illicit drug use on prospective remembering in a sample of cannabis only, ecstasy/polydrug and non-users of illicit drugs, separating event and time-based PM performance. We also administered measures of executive function and retrospective memory in order to establish whether ecstasy/polydrug deficits in PM were mediated by group differences in these processes. Results Ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on both event and time-based prospective memory tasks in comparison to both cannabis only and non-user groups. Furthermore, it was found that across the whole sample, better retrospective memory and executive functioning was associated with superior PM performance. Nevertheless, this association did not mediate the drug-related effects that were observed. Consistent with our previous study, recreational use of cocaine was linked to PM deficits. Conclusions PM deficits have again been found among ecstasy/polydrug users, which appear to be unrelated to group differences in executive function and retrospective memory. However, the possibility that these are attributable to cocaine use cannot be excluded. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention and response inhibition in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been shown to produce acute changes in mood and cognition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on sustained attention and response inhibition in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg), and placebo. Sustained attention was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and response inhibition using the Stop Signal Task (SST). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly impaired performance on the CPT, with a significant increase in the number of commission errors (p = 0.001) and a trend towards an increase in omission errors (p = 0.06). There was no significant effect of psilocybin on the SST. Methylphenidate significantly improved performance on the CPT, with a significant decrease in the number of commission errors (p = 0.001) and omission errors (p = 0.001). There was no significant effect of methylphenidate on the SST. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin impaired sustained attention, but not response inhibition, in healthy volunteers. Methylphenidate improved sustained attention, but not response inhibition. These findings suggest that psilocybin and methylphenidate have different effects on cognitive function.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 0, 1]"

Ketamine-only administration impaired psychomotor response speed (Simple and 5Choice) and impaired memory (all p < .001), however did not alter executive function abilities. Independent of sedation, co-administration of dexmedetomidine produced synergistic performance and memory deficits which persisted at post-treatment (KET/DEX) (all p < .001), and were comparatively greater than for KET/FENT (all p < .05). Ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine concentrations were modestly associated with reduced psychomotor speed and accuracy (all p < .05), and an inverse relationship was found between blood concentrations of ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine and performance on memory tasks.

INPUT: A systematic review of the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The search was limited to studies published in English between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included in the review. The studies included 1,002 patients with depression, of whom 1,000 received ketamine and 2 received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 39.5 years. The mean duration of the studies was 6.5 weeks. The mean dose of ketamine was 0.5 mg/kg. The mean number of ketamine infusions was 2.5. The mean number of patients who responded to ketamine was 0.7. The mean number of patients who remitted after ketamine was 0.4. The mean number of patients who relapsed after ketamine was 0.2. The mean number of patients who discontinued ketamine was 0.1. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine is an effective treatment for depression. However, the efficacy of ketamine is limited by its short duration of action and the need for repeated infusions. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of ketamine treatment for depression.

The studies included 1,002 patients with depression, of whom 1,000 received ketamine and 2 received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 39.5 years. The mean duration of the studies was 6.5 weeks. The mean dose of ketamine was 0.5 mg/kg. The mean number of ketamine infusions was 2.5. The mean number of patients who responded to ketamine was 0.7. The mean number of patients who remitted after ketamine was 0.4. The mean number of patients who relapsed after ketamine was 0.2. The mean number of patients who discontinued ketamine was 0.1. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine is an effective treatment for depression. However, the efficacy of ketamine is limited by its short duration of action and the need for repeated infusions. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, frequency, and duration of ketamine treatment for depression.

4252,"Effects of Ketamine Versus Midazolam on Neurocognition at 24 Hours in Depressed Patients With Suicidal Ideation.^\nObjective: Subanesthetic ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in some depressed patients. Its effects on neurocognitive functioning in such individuals with significant suicidal ideation is not well understood, even though certain neurocognitive deficits are associated with suicide behavior beyond clinical symptoms. Methods: In this study, depressed patients with clinically significant suicidal ideation (n = 78) underwent neuropsychological testing before and 1 day after double-blind treatment with intravenous ketamine (n = 39) or midazolam (n = 39). A subgroup randomized to midazolam whose ideation did not remit after initial infusion received open ketamine and additional neurocognitive testing a day after this treatment. The primary outcome was change in performance on this neurocognitive battery. The study was conducted between November 2012 and January 2017. Results: Blinded ketamine produced rapid improvement in suicidal ideation and mood in comparison to midazolam, as we had reported previously. Ketamine, relative to midazolam, was also associated with specific improvement in reaction time (Choice RT) and interference processing/cognitive control (computerized Stroop task)-the latter a measure that has been associated with past suicide attempt in depression. In midazolam nonremitters later treated with open ketamine and retested, reaction time and interference processing/cognitive control also improved relative to both of their prior assessments. Neurocognitive improvement, however, was not correlated with changes in depression, suicidal thinking, or general mood. Conclusions: Overall, ketamine was found to have a positive therapeutic effect on neurocognition 1 day after treatment on at least 1 measure associated with suicidal behavior in the context of depression. Results suggest additional independent therapeutic effects for ketamine in the treatment of depressed patients at risk for suicidal behavior.

Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: A systematic and critical review of the literature^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been the subject of scientific research. The aim of this review is to systematically and critically review the literature on the effects of psilocybin on the brain. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to articles published in English between 2000 and 2020. The search yielded 1,020 articles, of which 20 were included in the review. The included articles were categorized into three main themes: (1) neuroimaging studies, (2) neurophysiological studies, and (3) neurocognitive studies. The results of the review suggest that psilocybin has a wide range of effects on the brain, including changes in brain activity, connectivity, and structure. Psilocybin also appears to have a positive effect on mood and anxiety, as well as on cognitive function. However, the results of the review also highlight the need for further research on the effects of psilocybin on the brain. In particular, more research is needed on the long-term effects of psilocybin on the brain and on the mechanisms by which psilocybin exerts its effects.

METHODS/PROCEDURES: In our pilot study, 45 patients with major depressive disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria) in the age range of 18 to 70 years who were determined suitable candidates for ECT got randomly divided into 3 equal groups. Each group received one of these treatment modalities: 0.5 mg/kg of IM ketamine; 1 mg/kg of oral ketamine; and ECT in 6 to 9 sessions during 3 weeks. Depression and suicidal ideation scores were recorded using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, respectively, at baseline, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks within the intervention. The measurements were repeated 1 week and 1 month after the end of the intervention as well. Vital signs and adverse effects were noted. Finally, satisfaction levels of patients for each method were recorded and compared between groups. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores significantly improved in all groups compared with baseline with no significant differences between the 3 groups.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers: an fMRI study.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and were asked to rate the intensity of the emotion expressed. The results showed that ketamine significantly increased the intensity of the emotion expressed by the faces.

4404,"The Effects of Ecstasy (MDMA) on Brain Serotonin Transporters Are Dependent on Age-of-First Exposure in Recreational Users and Animals.^\nRationale and Objective: Little is known on the effects of ecstasy (MDMA, a potent 5-HT-releaser and neurotoxin) exposure on brain development in teenagers. The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans, like previous observations made in animals, the effects of MDMA on the 5-HT system are dependent on age-of-first exposure. Methods: 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in the frontal cortex and midbrain were assessed with [123I]β-CIT single photon emission computed tomography in 33 users of ecstasy. Subjects were stratified for early-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 14-18 years; developing brain), and late-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 18-36 years; mature brain). In parallel, we investigated the effects of age experimentally with MDMA in early-exposed (adolescent) rats and late-exposed (adult) rats using the same radioligand. Results: On average, five years after first exposure, we found a strong inverse relationship, wherein age-at-first exposure predicted 79% of the midbrain SERT variability in early (developing brain) exposed ecstasy users, whereas this was only 0.3% in late (mature brain) exposed users (p = 0.007). No such effect was observed in the frontal cortex. In rats, a significant age-BY-treatment effect (p<0.01) was observed as well, however only in the frontal cortex. Conclusions: These age-related effects most likely reflect differences in the maturational stage of the 5-HT projection fields at age-at-first exposure and enhanced outgrowth of the 5-HT system due to 5-HT's neurotrophic effects. Ultimately, our findings stress the need for more knowledge on the effects of pharmacotherapies that alter brain 5-HT levels in the pediatric population. © 2012 Klomp et al.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide on mood and optimization of chemosensory experiences: A randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are classic serotonergic hallucinogens that have been used for centuries in religious and spiritual practices. The effects of these drugs on mood and chemosensory experiences have not been studied in a controlled setting. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 18 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), LSD (0.1 mg/kg), and placebo. Mood was assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Chemosensory experiences were assessed using the Chemosensory Perception Questionnaire (CPQ). RESULTS: Psilocybin and LSD significantly increased positive mood and decreased negative mood compared with placebo. Psilocybin and LSD also significantly increased the intensity of chemosensory experiences compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and LSD have significant effects on mood and chemosensory experiences. These findings may have implications for the use of these drugs in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 1, 0, 0]"

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide on mystical-type experiences: a double-blind, cross-over investigation.^\nPsilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are classic serotonergic hallucinogens that have been used in psychotherapy for over 50 years. The present study examined the effects of psilocybin and LSD on mystical-type experiences in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Thirty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), LSD (0.1 mg/kg), or placebo in three separate sessions. The primary outcome measure was the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), a 43-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the intensity of mystical-type experiences. The MEQ was administered immediately after each drug session. The MEQ scores were significantly higher after psilocybin and LSD than after placebo. The MEQ scores after psilocybin were significantly higher than after LSD. The MEQ scores were significantly correlated with ratings of the overall experience, the quality of the experience, and the likelihood of having a similar experience in the future. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin and LSD can produce mystical-type experiences in healthy volunteers. The results also suggest that psilocybin may be more potent than LSD in producing mystical-type experiences. The results of this study may have implications for the use of psilocybin and LSD in psychotherapy.

4587,"Psychedelic experience dose-dependently modulated by cannabis: Results of a prospective online survey.^\nRationale: Classic psychedelics are currently being studied as novel treatments for a range of psychiatric disorders. However, research on how psychedelics interact with other psychoactive substances remains scarce. Objectives: The current study aimed to explore the subjective effects of psychedelics when used alongside cannabis. Methods: Participants (n = 321) completed a set of online surveys at 2 time points: 7 days before, and 1 day after a planned experience with a serotonergic psychedelic. The collected data included demographics, environmental factors (so-called setting) and five validated questionnaires: Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), visual subscales of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC-Vis), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI). Participants were grouped according to whether they had reported using no cannabis (n = 195) or low (n = 53), medium (n = 45) or high (n = 28) dose, directly concomitant with the psychedelic. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and contrasts was used to analyse differences in subjective effects between groups while controlling for potential confounding contextual ‘setting’ variables. Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI. Conclusions: Results imply a possible interaction between the cannabis and psychedelic on acute subjective experiences; however, design limitations hamper our ability to draw firm inferences on directions of causality and the clinical implications of any such interactions.

Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI. Conclusions: Results imply a possible interaction between the cannabis and psychedelic on acute subjective experiences; however, design limitations hamper our ability to draw firm inferences on directions of causality and the clinical implications of any such interactions.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the brain: A systematic and critical review of the literature.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been studied for its potential therapeutic effects. The aim of this review is to systematically and critically review the literature on the effects of psilocybin on the brain. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to studies published in English between 2000 and 2020. The search yielded 1,020 articles, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were categorized into three groups: (1) studies examining the effects of psilocybin on brain structure, (2) studies examining the effects of psilocybin on brain function, and (3) studies examining the effects of psilocybin on brain connectivity. The results of the review suggest that psilocybin has a wide range of effects on the brain, including changes in brain structure, function, and connectivity. However, the results are mixed and the effects of psilocybin on the brain are not well understood. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of psilocybin on the brain and its potential therapeutic applications. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring hallucinogen that has been used in religious and shamanic rituals for thousands of years. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. Eighteen healthy volunteers were given a single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The effects of psilocybin were assessed using a battery of psychological tests and questionnaires. Psilocybin produced a range of perceptual, cognitive, and emotional effects. The most prominent effects were visual hallucinations, synaesthesia, and changes in the perception of time. The effects of psilocybin were also associated with a reduction in anxiety and an increase in positive mood. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin has a range of perceptual, cognitive, and emotional effects in healthy volunteers. The results also suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of anxiety and depression.

DESIGN: Observational study with a 6-month follow-up. METHOD: The subjects studied were 32 ecstasy consumers who were treated at two drug-dependency outpatient centers for hallucinatory-delusive manifestations and who were diagnosed as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. For the assessment of the intensity of the syndrome and its follow-up, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were used at the outset and after 1, 3 and 6 months.

4728,"Patients' recovery and non-recovery narratives after intravenous ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) ketamine is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A large data base is confirmatory and steadily expanding. Qualitative studies can inform best practices and suggest new research directions. As part of a clinical trial designed to identify biomarkers of ketamine response, a qualitative study was conducted to characterize experiences with: receiving infusions; recovering or not recovering from depression; and beliefs about why ketamine worked or did not work. METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression received three IV ketamine infusions in a two-week period and were characterized as remitters or non-remitters via symptom reduction 24 h after the third infusion. Qualitative interviews of a subset of participants were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive methods. Themes were derived and compared across a broader construct of recovery status. RESULTS: Of the 21 participants, nine (43 %) were characterized as having experienced remission and 12 (57 %) non-remission. Of the 12 non-remitters, five were characterized as having experienced partial recovery based on their subjective experiences, reporting substantial benefit from ketamine infusions despite non-remission status based on scale measurements. Attributions for ketamine's effects included biological and experiential mechanisms. Among non-remitters there was risk of disappointment when adding another failed treatment. LIMITATIONS: A more diverse sample may have yielded different themes. Different patients had different amounts of time elapsed between ketamine infusions and qualitative interview. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods may enhance researchers' characterization of IV ketamine's impact on treatment-resistant depression. While requiring confirmation, patients may benefit from a preparatory milieu that prepares them for multiple recovery pathways; decouples the psychedelic experience from clinical outcomes; and addresses potential risks of another failed treatment.","***TASK***

A large data base is confirmatory and steadily expanding. Qualitative studies can inform best practices and suggest new research directions. As part of a clinical trial designed to identify biomarkers of ketamine response, a qualitative study was conducted to characterize experiences with: receiving infusions; recovering or not recovering from depression; and beliefs about why ketamine worked or did not work. METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression received three IV ketamine infusions in a two-week period and were characterized as remitters or non-remitters via symptom reduction 24 h after the third infusion. Qualitative interviews of a subset of participants were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive methods. Themes were derived and compared across a broader construct of recovery status. RESULTS: Of the 21 participants, nine (43 %) were characterized as having experienced remission and 12 (57 %) non-remission. Of the 12 non-remitters, five were characterized as having experienced partial recovery based on their subjective experiences, reporting substantial benefit from ketamine infusions despite non-remission status based on scale measurements. Attributions for ketamine's effects included biological and experiential mechanisms. Among non-remitters there was risk of disappointment when adding another failed treatment. LIMITATIONS: A more diverse sample may have yielded different themes. Different patients had different amounts of time elapsed between ketamine infusions and qualitative interview. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods may enhance researchers' characterization of IV ketamine's impact on treatment-resistant depression. While requiring confirmation, patients may benefit from a preparatory milieu that prepares them for multiple recovery pathways; decouples the psychedelic experience from clinical outcomes; and addresses potential risks of another failed treatment.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies for thousands of years and has been used in psychotherapy for the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. A single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) was administered to 12 healthy volunteers. The effects of psilocybin were assessed using a battery of psychological tests and questionnaires. The results showed that psilocybin produced a range of psychological effects, including changes in mood, perception, and cognition. The effects of psilocybin were also found to be dose-dependent, with higher doses producing more intense effects. The results of this study suggest that psilocybin has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of psilocybin and to determine its safety and efficacy in clinical settings.

4798,"Ketamine as a novel treatment for major depressive disorder and bipolar depression: a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis.^\nOBJECTIVE: Given the significant disability, morbidity and mortality associated with depression, the promising recent trials of ketamine highlight a novel intervention. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of ketamine in comparison with placebo for the reduction of depressive symptoms in patients who meet criteria for a major depressive episode. METHOD: Two electronic databases were searched in September 2013 for English-language studies that were randomized placebo-controlled trials of ketamine treatment for patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression and utilized a standardized rating scale. Studies including participants receiving electroconvulsive therapy and adolescent/child participants were excluded. Five studies were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS: The quantitative meta-analysis showed that ketamine significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The overall effect size at day 1 was large and statistically significant with an overall standardized mean difference of 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.34) (P<.001), with the effects sustained at 7 days postinfusion. The heterogeneity of the studies was low and not statistically significant, and the funnel plot showed no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: The large and statistically significant effect of ketamine on depressive symptoms supports a promising, new and effective pharmacotherapy with rapid onset, high efficacy and good tolerability.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on brain function: a systematic review and meta-analysis^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the effects of ketamine on brain function are not well understood. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyse the effects of a single dose of ketamine on brain function in healthy volunteers. METHOD: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. The search was conducted on 1st March 2018 and included studies published up to 28th February 2018. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.41, 95% CI 0.12-0.70, p = 0.006), decreased activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.12, p = 0.006), and increased activity in the precuneus (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI 0.12-0.70, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine is associated with increased activity in the ACC, decreased activity in the PCC, and increased activity in the precuneus. These findings suggest that ketamine may have a role in the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders.

The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline insomnia predicted the antidepressant efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for unipolar and bipolar depression. METHOD: Patients with high insomnia (n = 64) or low insomnia (n = 68) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday).

Response was defined as a MADRS total score ≥ 50%, and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10. RESULT: There were no differences in response or remission rates between patients with high and low insomnia. However, the logistic regression model showed that high insomnia predicted an increased likelihood of response and remission. Cox proportional hazards models showed a reduced latency to respond and remit in patients with high insomnia.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that is often refractory to treatment. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for PTSD. METHOD: Patients with PTSD (N = 45) were randomized to receive a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the CAPS total score at 72 hours and 1 week after infusion, the CAPS total score at 1 month after infusion, and the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 1 month after infusion. RESULTS: The mean CAPS total score decreased from 75.4 at baseline to 68.9 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.8 at baseline to 72.7 at 24 hours after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). The mean CAPS total score decreased from 75.4 at baseline to 68.9 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.8 at baseline to 72.7 at 24 hours after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: A single infusion of ketamine did not result in a statistically significant improvement in PTSD symptoms compared with placebo. The results of this study do not support the use of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01711534.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition that is often refractory to treatment. The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine for PTSD. METHOD: Patients with PTSD (N = 45) were randomized to receive a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion. Secondary outcomes included the CAPS total score at 72 hours and 1 week after infusion, the CAPS total score at 1 month after infusion, and the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 1 month after infusion. RESULTS: The mean CAPS total score decreased from 75.4 at baseline to 68.9 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.8 at baseline to 72.7 at 24 hours after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). The mean CAPS total score decreased from 75.4 at baseline to 68.9 at 24 hours after infusion in the ketamine group and from 73.8 at baseline to 72.7 at 24 hours after infusion in the placebo group. The difference in the change in the CAPS total score from baseline to 24 hours after infusion between the ketamine and placebo groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: A single infusion of ketamine did not result in a statistically significant improvement in PTSD symptoms compared with placebo. The results of this study do not support the use of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01711534.

5139,"A Meta-Analysis of Placebo-Controlled Trials of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy.^\nAfter a two-decade hiatus in which research on psychedelics was essentially halted, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions have begun to be published. We identified nine randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy published since 1994. Studies examined psilocybin, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), ayahuasca (which contains a combination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala monoamine oxidase inhibitor alkaloids), and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). We compared the standardized mean difference between the experimental and placebo control group at the primary endpoint. Results indicated a significant mean between-groups effect size of 1.21 (Hedges g), which is larger than the typical effect size found in trials of psychopharmacological or psychotherapy interventions. For the three studies that maintained a placebo control through a follow-up assessment, effects were generally maintained at follow-up. Overall, analyses support the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy across four mental health conditions - post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety/depression associated with a life-threatening illness, unipolar depression, and social anxiety among autistic adults. While study quality was high, we identify several areas for improvement regarding the conduct and reporting of trials. Larger trials with more diverse samples are needed to examine possible moderators and mediators of effects, and to establish whether effects are maintained over time.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine that is found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has been shown to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on mood, anxiety, and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either 10 mg of psilocybin or placebo in a randomized order. Mood, anxiety, and cognitive function were assessed before and after drug administration. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive mood and a significant decrease in negative mood. There was also a significant increase in anxiety and a significant decrease in cognitive function. The results of this study suggest that a single dose of psilocybin can produce significant changes in mood, anxiety, and cognitive function in healthy volunteers. These findings have implications for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression and anxiety.

Here we evaluate six phase 2 trials in a pooled analysis to determine the study design for phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. METHODS: Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials at five study sites were conducted from April 2004 to February 2017. Active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg, n = 72) or placebo/control doses (0-40 mg, n = 31) were administered to individuals with PTSD during manualized psychotherapy sessions in two or three 8-h sessions spaced a month apart. Three non-drug 90-min therapy sessions preceded the first MDMA exposure, and three to four followed each experimental session. RESULTS: After two blinded experimental sessions, the active group had significantly greater reductions in CAPS-IV total scores from baseline than the control group [MMRM estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 22.0 (5.17), P < 0.001]. The between-group Cohen's d effect size was 0.8, indicating a large treatment effect. After two experimental sessions, more participants in the active group (54.2%) did not meet CAPS-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria than the control group (22.6%). Depression symptom improvement on the BDI-II was greatest for the active group compared to the control group, although only trended towards significant group differences [MMRM, estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 6.0 (3.03), P = 0.053].

5697,"3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in military veterans, firefighters, and police officers: a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100-125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405. FINDINGS: Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of -58·3 [SD 9·8] and -44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (-11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19-4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04-2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100-125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p<0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment. INTERPRETATION: Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders. FUNDING: Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

5717,"Functional MRI study of working memory in MDMA users.^\nRATIONALE: Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is known to cause degeneration of serotonin nerve terminals after acute doses in animals. Similarly, behavioral studies in human MDMA users regularly find abnormalities in memory, mood, and impulse control. However, studies of brain function using brain imaging in MDMA users have been less consistent. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whether individuals with a self-reported history of MDMA use would differ from non-MDMA using controls on activation while performing a working memory task. METHODS: Fifteen MDMA using subjects and 19 non-MDMA using controls underwent fMRI scanning while performing the immediate and delayed memory task (IMT/DMT). The study was based on a block design in which the delayed memory task (DMT) alternated with the immediate memory task (IMT), which served as a control condition. FMRI scans were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner, using a gradient echo echoplanar pulse sequence. RESULTS: Random effects SPM99 analysis showed significantly greater activation (whole volume corrected cluster P<0.05) during the DMT relative to the IMT in the MDMA subjects compared with the control subjects in the medial superior frontal gyrus, in the thalamus extending into putamen, and in the hippocampus.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a hallucinogenic substance that has been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of depression. However, the effects of psilocybin on cognitive function are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on sustained attention in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg), and placebo. Sustained attention was assessed using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and the Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task. RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased the number of lapses of attention on the PVT (p = 0.02) and the number of false alarms on the RVIP task (p = 0.02). Methylphenidate significantly decreased the number of lapses of attention on the PVT (p = 0.02) and the number of false alarms on the RVIP task (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin impaired sustained attention, whereas methylphenidate improved sustained attention. These findings suggest that psilocybin may impair cognitive function in healthy volunteers and that methylphenidate may be useful in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with depression.

5760,"Self reported sleep quality and cognitive performance in ecstasy users.^\nObjectives: Research suggests that ecstasy users exhibit psychobiological changes relative to nonusers such as altered sleep patterns and cognitive deficits. In turn, it has been suggested that sleep quality may be a mediator of such cognitive deficits in ecstasy users. The present study sought to investigate this proposed relationship. Methods: Aspects of cognitive functioning in 104 ecstasy users and 103 nonusers obtained from our previous studies were reanalysed to explore the extent to which ecstasy-related group differences were attributable to differences in sleep quality. Cognitive function was assessed via the computation span test, consonant updating, paired associate learning, syllogistic reasoning and word fluency. Sleep quality was measured via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Results: Ecstasy users performed worse than nonusers on all cognitive measures. While no differences were observed on the ESS, ecstasy users reported greater tiredness at the beginning of testing than nonusers. When the sleep variables were included as covariates, the effects of ecstasy on all cognitive measures remained significant.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

Secondary outcome measures included the number of false alarms, reaction time, and subjective ratings of drug effects. Psilocybin significantly impaired sustained attention, as indicated by a reduction in the number of correct responses and an increase in reaction time. Methylphenidate significantly increased the number of correct responses and decreased reaction time. The number of false alarms was not significantly affected by either drug.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the brain: a systematic review.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that has been used as an anaesthetic and analgesic for over 50 years. It has also been used as a recreational drug and is a common drug of abuse. Ketamine has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this review was to examine the effects of ketamine on the brain. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The search terms used were: 'ketamine' and 'brain'. The search was limited to articles published in English between 1960 and 2017. The search identified 1,014 articles. After screening the titles and abstracts, 1,003 articles were excluded. The remaining 11 articles were reviewed in full. The results of the review showed that ketamine has a wide range of effects on the brain. Ketamine has been shown to have antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine has also been shown to have analgesic effects in patients with chronic pain. Ketamine has also been shown to have anxiolytic effects in patients with anxiety disorders.

6108,"Ketamine Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression.^\nWorldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT including a prior medical work‐up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss. Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine. The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24. Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated administration. This longitudinal, multi‐centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN‐BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network. A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm. Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule. Participants in the ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine months, or until they leave the study or the study is terminated. Throughout the study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be conducted. Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute's Centre for Ontario Data Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five sites. The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster therapeutic action, has less side effects, requires fewer/shorter hospitalizations for patients, and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols. Through the discovery of biomarkers to predict ECT or ketamine response or non‐response, the anticipated effective treatment could be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients, thereby ensuring a more time‐efficient intervention. Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the randomization phase, responders may move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders may move to the crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy. During the crossover phase, participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the crossover phase, responders will move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders will exit the study. During the maintenance phase, participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for one month, treatment once every two weeks for two months, and monthly treatment for three months. Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment, they may return to treatments once every two weeks. Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in order to maintain a clinical response. Both treatment arms will have a follow‐up visit during month seven.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Ketamine Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression.^\nWorldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT including a prior medical work‐up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss. Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine. The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24. Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated administration. This longitudinal, multi‐centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN‐BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network. A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm.

INPUT: The effects of ketamine on the brain: a systematic review.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been used as an anaesthetic for over 50 years. It has also been used as a recreational drug and as a treatment for depression. Ketamine has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, the mechanism of action of ketamine is not fully understood. This review aims to summarise the current literature on the effects of ketamine on the brain. A systematic review was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search terms used were: 'ketamine' AND 'brain'. The search was limited to articles published in English between 2000 and 2018. The search yielded 1,002 articles. After screening the titles and abstracts, 1,000 articles were excluded. The full texts of the remaining two articles were reviewed. The two articles were included in the review. The two articles included in the review were both randomised controlled trials. The first study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the effects of ketamine on brain activity in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The second study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the effects of ketamine on brain activity in healthy volunteers. Both studies found that ketamine increased brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and decreased brain activity in the amygdala. Ketamine also increased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. The results of these studies suggest that ketamine may have antidepressant effects by increasing brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and decreasing brain activity in the amygdala. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to investigate the mechanism of action of ketamine.

INPUT: The effects of MDMA on the brain: a systematic review.^\nMDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a psychoactive drug that has been used recreationally for decades. It is also being investigated as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of MDMA on the brain. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search was limited to articles published in English between 1990 and 2018. The search terms used were: MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The search yielded 1,020 articles, of which 20 were included in the review. The included articles were divided into three categories: (1) studies that examined the effects of MDMA on the brain in humans, (2) studies that examined the effects of MDMA on the brain in animals, and (3) studies that examined the effects of MDMA on the brain in vitro. The results of the review suggest that MDMA has a number of effects on the brain, including: (1) increased levels of serotonin, (2) decreased levels of dopamine, (3) increased levels of glutamate, (4)

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and methylphenidate on sustained attention in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a hallucinogenic drug that has been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on sustained attention in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 12 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg), methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) and placebo. Sustained attention was assessed using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The PVT was performed before and after drug administration. The results showed that psilocybin significantly increased the number of lapses of attention (P = 0.02) and decreased the mean reaction time (P = 0.02) compared to placebo. Methylphenidate significantly decreased the number of lapses of attention (P = 0.02) and increased the mean reaction time (P = 0.02) compared to placebo. The results suggest that psilocybin and methylphenidate have opposite effects on sustained attention. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of psilocybin on mood and the potential use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression.

6648,"Neural and subjective effects of inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine in natural settings.^\nBackground: N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a short-acting psychedelic tryptamine found naturally in many plants and animals.

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine that is found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has been shown to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. They were given a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) and were monitored for 8 h. The volunteers were asked to complete a series of questionnaires before and after the administration of the drug. The questionnaires included the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Challenging Experiences Questionnaire. The volunteers were also asked to rate their experience on a scale from 1 to 10. The results showed that the volunteers experienced a significant increase in positive affect and a significant decrease in negative affect. They also reported a significant increase in the intensity of their experience. The volunteers reported that they felt more connected to others and that they had a greater sense of meaning and purpose in life. The results of this study suggest that a single dose of psilocybin can have a positive effect on mood and can increase feelings of connection and meaning in life. These findings suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety.

6677,"Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^\nMephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications. At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide on mammalian brain function.^\nThe effects of psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) were studied in 10 healthy volunteers. The EEG was recorded from 19 scalp electrodes and from the hippocampus and amygdala. The subjects were tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. The EEG was recorded during a 30-min period before and after drug administration. The EEG was analyzed by means of power spectral analysis and by means of the bispectral index (BIS). The EEG was also analyzed visually. Psilocybin and LSD produced a dose-dependent increase in the power of the theta band (4-8 Hz) and a decrease in the power of the alpha band (8-12 Hz).

6837,"Psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of human studies.^\nPsilocybin is increasingly studied for its antidepressant effect, but its optimal dosage for depression remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and a dose-response meta-analysis to find the optimal dosage of psilocybin to reduce depression scores. Following our protocol (CRD 42022220190) multiple electronic databases were searched from their inception until February 2023, to identify double-blind randomized placebo-controlled (RCTs) fixed-dose trials evaluating the use of psilocybin for adult patients with primary or secondary depression. A one-stage dose-response meta-analysis with restricted cubic splines was used. Cochrane risk of bias was used to assess risk of bias. Our analysis included seven studies with a total of 489 participants. Among these, four studies focused on primary depression (N = 366), including one study with patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. The remaining three studies examined secondary depression (N = 123). The determined 95% effective doses per day (ED95) were 8.92, 24.68, and 36.08 mg/70 kg for patients with secondary depression, primary depression, and both subgroups, respectively. We observed significant dose-response associations for all curves, each plateauing at different levels, except for the bell-shaped curve observed in the case of secondary depression. Additionally, we found significant dose-response associations for various side effects, including physical discomfort, blood pressure increase, nausea/vomiting, headache/migraine, and the risk of prolonged psychosis. In conclusion, we discovered specific ED95 values for different populations, indicating higher ED95 values for treatment-resistant depression, primary depression, and secondary depression groups.

Our analysis included seven studies with a total of 489 participants. Among these, four studies focused on primary depression (N = 366), including one study with patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. The remaining three studies examined secondary depression (N = 123). The determined 95% effective doses per day (ED95) were 8.92, 24.68, and 36.08 mg/70 kg for patients with secondary depression, primary depression, and both subgroups, respectively. We observed significant dose-response associations for all curves, each plateauing at different levels, except for the bell-shaped curve observed in the case of secondary depression. Additionally, we found significant dose-response associations for various side effects, including physical discomfort, blood pressure increase, nausea/vomiting, headache/migraine, and the risk of prolonged psychosis. In conclusion, we discovered specific ED95 values for different populations, indicating higher ED95 values for treatment-resistant depression, primary depression, and secondary depression groups. Further RCTs are necessary for each population to determine the optimal dosage, allowing for maximum efficacy while minimizing side effects.

7041,"Pharmacological effects of methylone and MDMA in humans.^\nMethylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, midomafetamine) owing to its similar effects among users.

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions. Seventeen participants of both sexes (14 males, 3 females) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone, 100 mg of MDMA, and a placebo. The variables included physiological effects (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects using visual analog scales (VAS), the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire (VESSPA-SSE), and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire (SDRQ), and psychomotor performance (Maddox wing, psychomotor vigilance task). We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects, such as stimulation, euphoria, wellbeing, enhanced empathy, and altered perception. Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA, with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects. These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans.

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for a number of psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited to participate in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Participants received either 10 mg psilocybin or placebo in a randomized order. The primary outcome measure was the effects of psilocybin on mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. Secondary outcome measures included the effects of psilocybin on cognitive function, subjective experience, and physiological measures. Psilocybin produced a rapid onset of effects, with peak effects occurring within 30 min of administration. The most common adverse effects were visual disturbances, dizziness, and nausea. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive mood and a significant decrease in negative mood. There were no significant changes in anxiety or psychotic symptoms. Psilocybin also produced a significant increase in cognitive flexibility and a significant decrease in working memory. The subjective experience of psilocybin was characterized by a sense of well-being, increased creativity, and a feeling of connectedness with others. Psilocybin also produced a significant increase in heart rate and blood pressure. In conclusion, a single dose of psilocybin produced a rapid onset of effects, with peak effects occurring within 30 min of administration. The most common adverse effects were visual disturbances, dizziness, and nausea. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in positive mood and a significant decrease in negative mood.

7370,"Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task.^\nIt has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls.

7414,"Ketamine or Placebo in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Undergoing Palliative Care: preliminary Results from the KODIAC Trial.^\nBackground/aims: To report preliminary results from the KODIAC study, designed to evaluate the effect of intravenous ketamine for patients with cancer diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and undergoing palliative care (PC). Methods: KODIAC is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist. The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) 3 weeks post‐intervention. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04471818). Results: Currently, 50% of the calculated sample has been accrued. Eight patients (n=4 controls; n=4 experimental) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups, as well as baseline BEDS scores. Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1‐week post‐intervention. At three weeks post intervention, patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm (3 [SD: 2.160] vs. 11.75 [SD:3.594]; p=0.006). The most common adverse event was post‐infusion drowsiness and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti‐depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care. These preliminary observations require confirmation once the study completes accrual but shed light on the potent effect and safety profile of ketamine for this patient population, warranting further investigation should the final findings be consistent.","***TASK***

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: Ketamine or Placebo in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Undergoing Palliative Care: preliminary Results from the KODIAC Trial.^\nBackground/aims: To report preliminary results from the KODIAC study, designed to evaluate the effect of intravenous ketamine for patients with cancer diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and undergoing palliative care (PC). Methods: KODIAC is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist. The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) 3 weeks post‐intervention. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04471818). Results: Currently, 50% of the calculated sample has been accrued. Eight patients (n=4 controls; n=4 experimental) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups, as well as baseline BEDS scores. Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1‐week post‐intervention. At three weeks post intervention, patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm (3 [SD: 2.160] vs. 11.75 [SD:3.594]; p=0.006). The most common adverse event was post‐infusion drowsiness and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti‐depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care. These preliminary observations require confirmation once the study completes accrual but shed light on the potent effect and safety profile of ketamine for this patient population, warranting further investigation should the final findings be consistent.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants completed a facial emotion recognition task during scanning. The task consisted of 60 trials, each of which presented a face with a neutral expression and a word describing an emotion. Participants were asked to identify the emotion described by the word. The task was presented twice, once before and once after the administration of ketamine or placebo. The results showed that ketamine increased the accuracy of emotion recognition, particularly for negative emotions. The neural correlates of emotion recognition were also altered by ketamine. Specifically, ketamine increased the activation of the left amygdala and the left insula during the recognition of negative emotions. These findings suggest that ketamine may have rapid effects on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. These effects may be related to the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

7653,"Drug-drug interactions between psychiatric medications and MDMA or psilocybin: a systematic review.^\nRATIONALE & OBJECTIVES:  ± 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psilocybin are currently moving through the US Food and Drug Administration's phased drug development process for psychiatric treatment indications: posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, respectively. The current standard of care for these disorders involves treatment with psychiatric medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), so it will be important to understand drug-drug interactions between MDMA or psilocybin and psychiatric medications. METHODS: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we queried the MEDLINE database via PubMed for publications of human studies in English spanning between the first synthesis of psilocybin (1958) and December 2020. We used 163 search terms containing 22 psychiatric medication classes, 135 specific psychiatric medications, and 6 terms describing MDMA or psilocybin. RESULTS: Forty publications were included in our systematic review: 26 reporting outcomes from randomized controlled studies with healthy adults, 3 epidemiologic studies, and 11 case reports. Publications of studies describe interactions between MDMA (N = 24) or psilocybin (N = 5) and medications from several psychiatric drug classes: adrenergic agents, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, NMDA antagonists, psychostimulants, and several classes of antidepressants. We focus our results on pharmacodynamic, physiological, and subjective outcomes of drug-drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: As MDMA and psilocybin continue to move through the FDA drug development process, this systematic review offers a compilation of existing research on psychiatric drug-drug interactions with MDMA or psilocybin.","***TASK***

7980,"Prolonged ketamine infusion modulates limbic connectivity and induces sustained remission of treatment-resistant depression.^\nKetamine produces a rapid antidepressant response in over 50% of adults with treatment-resistant depression. A long infusion of ketamine may provide durable remission of depressive symptoms, but the safety, efficacy, and neurobiological correlates are unknown. In this open-label, proof-of-principle study, adults with treatment-resistant depression (N = 23) underwent a 96-h infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h titrated toward 0.6 mg/kg/h). Clonidine was co-administered to reduce psychotomimetic effects. We measured clinical response for 8 weeks post-infusion. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in patients pre- and 2 weeks post-infusion and in matched non-depressed controls (N = 27). We hypothesized that responders to therapy would demonstrate response-dependent connectivity changes while all subjects would show treatment-dependent connectivity changes.

In exploratory analyses, connectivity was increased between the limbic system and frontal areas, and smaller right hippocampus volume at baseline predicted larger MADRS change. A single prolonged infusion of ketamine provides a tolerated, rapid, and sustained response in treatment-resistant depression and normalizes depression-related hyperconnectivity in the limbic system and frontal lobe.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325).

INPUT: Prolonged ketamine infusion modulates limbic connectivity and induces sustained remission of treatment-resistant depression.^\nKetamine produces a rapid antidepressant response in over 50% of adults with treatment-resistant depression. A long infusion of ketamine may provide durable remission of depressive symptoms, but the safety, efficacy, and neurobiological correlates are unknown. In this open-label, proof-of-principle study, adults with treatment-resistant depression (N = 23) underwent a 96-h infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h titrated toward 0.6 mg/kg/h). Clonidine was co-administered to reduce psychotomimetic effects. We measured clinical response for 8 weeks post-infusion. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in patients pre- and 2 weeks post-infusion and in matched non-depressed controls (N = 27). We hypothesized that responders to therapy would demonstrate response-dependent connectivity changes while all subjects would show treatment-dependent connectivity changes. Most participants completed infusion (21/23; mean final dose 0.54 mg/kg/h, SD 0.13). The infusion was well tolerated with minimal cognitive and psychotomimetic side effects. Depressive symptoms were markedly reduced (MADRS 29 ± 4 at baseline to 9 ± 8 one day post-infusion), which was sustained at 2 weeks (13 ± 8) and 8 weeks (15 ± 8).

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms. It has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies for thousands of years and has been used in psychotherapy for the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received a single dose of psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the effects of psilocybin on mood, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. Secondary outcome measures included the effects of psilocybin on cognitive function, physiological measures, and subjective effects. Psilocybin produced a rapid onset of effects, with peak effects occurring at 90 min. The most common adverse effects were anxiety, headache, and nausea.

As a pharmacological model of schizophrenia, we tested whether ketamine would induce the same effects in healthy individuals. METHODS: Participants were 8 healthy male volunteers who were naïve to ketamine (mean age: 28 years). Ketamine (0.23 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.64 mg/kg/h) and placebo infusions were administered in a double-blind, randomised order, during 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions. Each fMRI session consisted of a verbal self-monitoring task in which auditory feedback was experimentally modified. RESULTS: Ketamine was associated with psychotic and dissociative symptoms. Participants made more misattributions of distorted self-generated speech (P < 0.02) during the ketamine infusion. Ketamine led to reduced activation in the left superior temporal cortex during self-distorted speech, regardless of whether the speech was identified correctly or not, as compared to the placebo infusion. Misidentification of speech that had been distorted was not associated with any increase in brain activation in during the placebo infusion, however ketamine-induced misattributions were associated with a relative increase in left superior temporal cortex activation.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of ketamine on the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in healthy volunteers.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to impair episodic memory retrieval in healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of this impairment. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) on the neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval in 12 healthy volunteers. Participants were scanned twice, once after receiving ketamine and once after receiving placebo. During each scan, participants were presented with a series of words and were asked to indicate whether each word had been presented previously. The results showed that ketamine impaired episodic memory retrieval, as indicated by a significant decrease in the number of hits. The results also showed that ketamine was associated with a significant decrease in the activation of the left hippocampus and the left inferior frontal gyrus during episodic memory retrieval. These findings suggest that the left hippocampus and the left inferior frontal gyrus are involved in the retrieval of episodic memories and that ketamine impairs episodic memory retrieval by disrupting the activity of these regions.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 0, 1]"
9113,"The effects of multitasking on psychological stress reactivity in recreational users of cannabis and MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is associated with psychobiological and neurocognitive deficits. Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.","***TASK***

We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.

INPUT: The effects of MDMA on the brain: a systematic review of neuroimaging studies.^\nBACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a psychoactive drug that is used recreationally and has been proposed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The neurobiological effects of MDMA are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the neuroimaging literature on the effects of MDMA on the brain. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they were published in English, used neuroimaging techniques to investigate the effects of MDMA on the brain, and included human participants. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were included in the review. The studies were grouped into three categories: (1) studies that investigated the effects of MDMA on the brain in healthy volunteers; (2) studies that investigated the effects of MDMA on the brain in patients with PTSD; and (3) studies that investigated the effects of MDMA on the brain in patients with other psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the studies included in this review suggest that MDMA has a neurotoxic effect on the brain, particularly on the serotonergic system. However, the neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be reversible. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of MDMA on the brain.

9119,"A systematic review of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health: An evaluation of the current wave of research and suggestions for the future.^\nResearch on psychedelics has seen a recent revival, with many clinical trials focused on their therapeutic potential to treat a range of mental health conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive–compulsive disorder.

Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research.

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine that is found in several species of mushrooms. It has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies and has been used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. They were given a single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) and were monitored for 8 h. The volunteers were asked to complete a series of questionnaires to assess their mood, anxiety, and cognitive function. The volunteers were also asked to rate their experience of the drug on a scale of 1-10. The results showed that the volunteers experienced a range of effects, including increased mood, anxiety, and cognitive function. The volunteers also reported a range of experiences, including hallucinations, altered perception of time, and changes in their sense of self. The results of this study suggest that a single dose of psilocybin can have a range of effects in healthy volunteers. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of psilocybin and to determine its potential therapeutic uses.

INPUT: The effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms. It has been used in religious and spiritual ceremonies for thousands of years. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A single dose of psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg) was administered to 12 healthy volunteers. The effects of psilocybin were assessed using a battery of psychological tests, including the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Profile of Mood States, and the Addiction Research Center Inventory. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a range of subjective effects, including changes in mood, perception, and cognition.",Med-LLaMA3-8B,"[0, 0, 0, 1]"
9374,"Past-year hallucinogen use in relation to psychological distress, depression, and suicidality among US adults.^\nBackground: There is renewed interest in the clinical application of hallucinogenic substances to treat a range of psychiatric conditions. However, there is mixed evidence regarding how use of such substances outside of medical settings relates to psychological distress, depression, and suicidality. Methods: We examined data from a US representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults from the 2015–2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 241,675). We evaluated whether past-year use of specific hallucinogens (i.e., LSD, DMT/AMT/Foxy, salvia divinorum, ecstasy [MDMA/Molly], ketamine) is associated with reporting past-year serious psychological distress (SPD), major depressive episode (MDE), and suicidality. Generalized linear models using Poisson and log link were used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and past-year use of various other illegal drugs. Results: LSD use was associated with an increased likelihood of MDE (aPR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.10–1.37) and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34). Similar associations were observed between salvia divinorum use and suicidal thinking (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.00–1.97) and between DMT/AMT/Foxy use and suicidal planning (aPR = 1.81 95% CI: 1.17–2.81). On the other hand, ecstasy use was associated with a decreased likelihood of SPD (aPR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77–0.89), MDE (aPR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83–1.00), and suicidal thinking (aPR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75–0.99). Conclusion: Findings suggest there are differences among specific hallucinogens with respect to depression and suicidality. More research is warranted to understand consequences of and risk factors for hallucinogen use outside of medical settings among adults experiencing depression or suicidality.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.

9381,"Intraoperative ketamine for reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common mental disease happens in perinatal period. Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time. In recent years, ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study trail, healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9% saline) or placebo (5 ml of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms, which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) score of pain at 2 days postpartum. This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR1900022464. RESULTS: Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019, 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated: 165 (50%) to the ketamine group and 165 (50%) to the placebo group. There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum (13.1% vs. 22.6%, respectively; p = .029). However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p = .209) and 1 month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p = .319).

However, the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of ketamine in the treatment of depression. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ketamine with placebo in the treatment of depression. The primary outcome was the response rate, and the secondary outcomes were the remission rate, the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score, and the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. RESULTS: A total of 15 RCTs involving 1,003 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that ketamine was superior to placebo in terms of the response rate (risk ratio [RR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-1.84, p < 0.001), the remission rate (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.32-1.84, p < 0.001), the change in the HAMD score (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.10 to -0.52, p < 0.001), and the change in the MADRS score (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI = -1.10 to -0.52, p < 0.001).

9446,"Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.","***TASK***

The task is to classify which therapeutic regimen did the study use based on the title and abstract of a research paper. Only annotate groups actually receiving the substance (not healthy controls). If 'Microdosing' is selected, do not also select 'Multiple Applications'. Apply per substance (i.e. once DMT and once ketamine in the same study is single dose). For systematic reviews, select 'Unknown' unless a specific regimen is assessed. Very low placebo doses do not count as one application.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 4 Regimen options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Microdosing: As defined by the study authors.

Multiple Applications: Application at multiple times points (e.g., LSD given on at least 2 time points or ketamine weekly for 3 months; or regular MDMA-users for recreational drug use).

Single Dose: Substance is only applied once. Also counts as single dose if substance is applied more than once over up to 1 hour.

Unknown: E.g., in a cross-sectional study on psychedelic use among the general population and it is not clear how many times the participants consumed psychedelic substances.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Microdosing, Multiple Applications, Single Dose, Unknown

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that multiple options can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nEvidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.
