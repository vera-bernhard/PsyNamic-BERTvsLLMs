6103,"A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg). Total amounts of MDMA to be administered per Experimental Session range from 80 mg to 180","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

8606,"Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine, as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.","***TASK***

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of the effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has shown promise in treating anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0.3, 0.2, or 0.15 mg/kg) or placebo in a 2:1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was the change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety subscale score from baseline to 1 week after dosing. RESULTS: Of 51 patients, 49 received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean change in HADS anxiety subscale score from baseline to 1 week after dosing was -10.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.9 to -6.7) in the 0.3-mg/kg group, -8.0 (95% CI, -11.7 to -4.3) in the 0.2-mg/kg group, -5.9 (95% CI, -10.1 to -1.7) in the 0.15-mg/kg group, and -3.8 (95% CI, -7.7 to 0.1) in the placebo group. The mean change in HADS anxiety subscale score was significantly greater in the 0.3-mg/kg group than in the placebo group (P=0.002). The mean change in HADS depression subscale score was -5.9 (95% CI, -9.1 to -2.7) in the 0.3-mg/kg group, -4.8 (95% CI, -8.1 to -1.5) in the 0.2-mg/kg group, -3.8 (95% CI, -7.1 to -0.5) in the 0.15-mg/kg group, and -2.8 (95% CI, -6.1 to 0.5) in the placebo group. The mean change in HADS depression subscale score was significantly greater in the 0.3-mg/kg group than in the placebo group (P=0.02).

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting in humans.^\nPsilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, has been shown to alter time perception in humans. However, the effects of psilocybin on temporal discounting, the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards, are unknown. We examined the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 19 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal discounting was assessed using a standard intertemporal choice task. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of a 60-s interval by 33% (p < 0.001) and decreased the perceived duration of a 120-s interval by 11% (p < 0.001). Psilocybin also increased the subjective value of a delayed reward by 10% (p < 0.001) and decreased the rate of temporal discounting by 12% (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and temporal discounting in humans.

56,"Single-Dose Synthetic Psilocybin With Psychotherapy for Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Type II Major Depressive Episodes: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a debilitating condition frequently associated with difficult-to-treat depressive episodes. Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression. OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit. RESULTS: Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d = 4.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P < .001). Repeat measures analysis of variance showed lower MADRS scores at all tested posttreatment time points, including the end point (Cohen d = 3.39; 95% CI, -33.19 to -16.95; adjusted P < .001). At week 3, 12 participants met the response criterion (50% decrease in MADRS), and 11 met remission criterion (MADRS score ≤10). At the study end point, 12 patients met both response and remission criteria. QIDS-SR scores and Q-LES-Q-SF scores demonstrated similar improvements. YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline.

INPUT: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Psychedelics on Depression.^\nBackground: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. The current standard of care for depression is limited by low efficacy and high relapse rates. Psychedelics have shown promise in treating depression, but the evidence base is limited. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of psychedelics on depression. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed the effects of psychedelics on depression. We conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs and a narrative synthesis of observational studies. Results: We identified 10 RCTs and 11 observational studies. The meta-analysis of RCTs showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms (standardized mean difference, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.29; P = .001). The narrative synthesis of observational studies showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms (standardized mean difference, -0.67; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.29; P = .001). Conclusions: Psychedelics may be effective in treating depression. However, the evidence base is limited, and further research is needed.

INPUT: A Qualitative Study of the Effects of Psilocybin on Depression and Anxiety.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic that has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety. However, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects are not well understood. Objective: To explore the subjective experiences of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression and anxiety. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study of 12 participants who received psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression and anxiety. We used a grounded theory approach to analyze the data. Results: Participants reported that psilocybin-assisted therapy led to a range of subjective experiences, including altered perceptions, emotions, and cognitions. These experiences were described as facilitating the development of new perspectives and insights, which led to reductions in depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Psilocybin-assisted therapy may be an effective treatment for depression and anxiety by facilitating the development of new perspectives and insights.

748,"Assessing the risk-benefit profile of classical psychedelics: a clinical review of second-wave psychedelic research.^\nRATIONALE: A broad reassessment of the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs has led to the initiation of multiple major clinical trials in an effort to advance their status to become FDA-approved medications, as well as local legislative efforts to legalize or decriminalize their use. OBJECTIVES: To use recently published data to assess potential risks and benefits of psychedelic drugs as therapeutics, as well as to synthesize what is currently known in order to generate fruitful future research directions. METHODS: A review of studies conducted since 1991 identified 14 clinical trials of classical psychedelics, including 11 of psilocybin (N = 257 participants), 1 of lysergic acid diethylamide (N = 12 participants), and 2 of ayahuasca (N = 46 participants). Other published studies (e.g., of healthy volunteers, survey studies, case reports, neuroimaging) were also considered for review. RESULTS: Published studies since 1991 largely support the hypothesis that small numbers of treatments with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can offer significant and sustained alleviation to symptoms of multiple psychiatric conditions. No serious adverse events attributed to psychedelic therapy have been reported. Existing studies have several limitations, including small sample sizes, inherent difficulty in blinding, relatively limited follow-up, and highly screened treatment populations. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial data have been gathered in the past 30 years suggesting that psychedelics are a potent treatment for a variety of common psychiatric conditions, though the ideal means of employing these substances to minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic effects remains controversial. Unique factors related to study design are vital for clinical researchers in the field to address.","***TASK***

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Assessing the risk-benefit profile of classical psychedelics: a clinical review of second-wave psychedelic research.^\nRATIONALE: A broad reassessment of the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs has led to the initiation of multiple major clinical trials in an effort to advance their status to become FDA-approved medications, as well as local legislative efforts to legalize or decriminalize their use. OBJECTIVES: To use recently published data to assess potential risks and benefits of psychedelic drugs as therapeutics, as well as to synthesize what is currently known in order to generate fruitful future research directions. METHODS: A review of studies conducted since 1991 identified 14 clinical trials of classical psychedelics, including 11 of psilocybin (N = 257 participants), 1 of lysergic acid diethylamide (N = 12 participants), and 2 of ayahuasca (N = 46 participants). Other published studies (e.g., of healthy volunteers, survey studies, case reports, neuroimaging) were also considered for review. RESULTS: Published studies since 1991 largely support the hypothesis that small numbers of treatments with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can offer significant and sustained alleviation to symptoms of multiple psychiatric conditions. No serious adverse events attributed to psychedelic therapy have been reported. Existing studies have several limitations, including small sample sizes, inherent difficulty in blinding, relatively limited follow-up, and highly screened treatment populations. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial data have been gathered in the past 30 years suggesting that psychedelics are a potent treatment for a variety of common psychiatric conditions, though the ideal means of employing these substances to minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic effects remains controversial. Unique factors related to study design are vital for clinical researchers in the field to address.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention.^\nPsilocybin, a classic psychedelic, is known to alter perception and cognition. However, the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention have not been investigated. We examined the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. Twenty-four healthy participants completed two sessions, one with psilocybin (210 μg/kg) and one with placebo, separated by 1 week. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal attention was assessed using a temporal orienting task. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals, and this effect was most pronounced for the shortest intervals. Psilocybin also impaired temporal attention, as indicated by slower reaction times and reduced accuracy in the temporal orienting task. These results suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and temporal attention, which may contribute to the subjective experience of time dilation and the altered sense of self that is characteristic of the psychedelic state.

941,"Psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity: A scoping review.^\nBackground: Research on psilocybin has become increasingly popular during the current psychedelic renaissance, which began in the early 1990s. Psilocybin’s effects on mental health are promising and there are ongoing efforts to investigate its clinical implementation and its effects on cognition. Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1–85 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects. We therefore recommend that future psilocybin research be conducted according to existing guidelines and include well-validated measures of cognition and creativity at multiple timepoints.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivated during goal-directed tasks. The DMN has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety, and is thought to be a target of psilocybin’s therapeutic effects. Aims: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of psilocybin on the DMN. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for studies that investigated the effects of psilocybin on the DMN. Results/outcomes: We identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed a significant decrease in DMN connectivity following psilocybin administration (d = -0.38, 95% CI = -0.65 to -0.11, p = 0.005). Conclusions/interpretation: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that psilocybin decreases DMN connectivity, which may be a mechanism by which psilocybin exerts its therapeutic effects.

2153,"Effects of ayahuasca on the endocannabinoid system of healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder: Results from two pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess endocannabinoid (anandamide, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) plasma levels in healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) after a single oral dose of ayahuasca or placebo. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of endocannabinoid plasma levels (baseline, 90 and 240 min after drug intake) from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In Study 1, 20 healthy volunteers ingested ayahuasca (average 1.58 mg/ml dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) or placebo, and in Study 2, 17 volunteers with SAD received ayahuasca (average 0.680 mg/ml DMT) or placebo. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in AEA concentrations in Study 2 after ayahuasca intake (Χ(2) (2) = 6.5, p = 0.03, Friedman test), and near significant differences (increases) were observed between baseline and 90 (Z = 0, p = 0.06, Wilcoxon test) and 240 (Z = 10, p = 0.06) minutes after ayahuasca intake. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that ayahuasca could modulate AEA levels in SAD patients, the high interindividual variability in both trials and the small samples preclude definitive conclusions. More research with larger samples is needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other hallucinogens in the endocannabinoid system.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Effects of ayahuasca on the endocannabinoid system of healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder: Results from two pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess endocannabinoid (anandamide, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) plasma levels in healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) after a single oral dose of ayahuasca or placebo. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of endocannabinoid plasma levels (baseline, 90 and 240 min after drug intake) from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In Study 1, 20 healthy volunteers ingested ayahuasca (average 1.58 mg/ml dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) or placebo, and in Study 2, 17 volunteers with SAD received ayahuasca (average 0.680 mg/ml DMT) or placebo. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in AEA concentrations in Study 2 after ayahuasca intake (Χ(2) (2) = 6.5, p = 0.03, Friedman test), and near significant differences (increases) were observed between baseline and 90 (Z = 0, p = 0.06, Wilcoxon test) and 240 (Z = 10, p = 0.06) minutes after ayahuasca intake. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that ayahuasca could modulate AEA levels in SAD patients, the high interindividual variability in both trials and the small samples preclude definitive conclusions. More research with larger samples is needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other hallucinogens in the endocannabinoid system.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to alter time perception. However, the effects of psilocybin on temporal attention, the ability to selectively attend to time intervals, have not been investigated. The present study examined the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention. Twenty-four healthy participants completed a temporal bisection task and a temporal orienting task before and after receiving psilocybin (200 μg/kg) or placebo. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals and decreased temporal attention. These findings suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and temporal attention, which may contribute to the subjective effects of the drug.

7425,"The effect of polymorphism at the serotonin transporter gene on decision-making, memory and executive function in ecstasy users and controls.^\nRationale: 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") is a popular drug of abuse known to result in depletions of the serotonin (5-HT) system. A number of studies have reported that ecstasy users differ from controls on a variety of measures of cognitive function. However, the literature is not consistent and many negative findings were also reported. One reason for such inconsistency might be interindividual variance in vulnerability to the deleterious effects of ecstasy due to a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that carriers of the s allele at the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), which was associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission relative to the l allele, would be most vulnerable to the effects of ecstasy on cognitive function. Methods: We assessed memory, decision-making, and executive function in ecstasy users and controls, stratifying by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR. Results: We observed that the 5-HTTLPR genotype groups differed on a number of measures in both the ecstasy users and the controls. While performing a risky decision-making task, ss and ls controls attended to differences in the probability of winning chosen gambles to a greater extent than the ll controls. However, this difference was dramatically attenuated in the ss ecstasy users. Furthermore, independent of ecstasy use, volunteers of the ss genotype outperformed the ll genotype on a visual planning task.

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

7903,"Ketamine amplifies induced gamma frequency oscillations in the human cerebral cortex.^\nAt subanaesthetic doses, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has demonstrated remarkable and rapid antidepressant efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood, with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high-frequency oscillatory power (Wood et al., 2012) noted in animal studies. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition. This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans, which may underlie the anti-depressant actions of ketamine.

I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Ketamine amplifies induced gamma frequency oscillations in the human cerebral cortex.^\nAt subanaesthetic doses, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has demonstrated remarkable and rapid antidepressant efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood, with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high-frequency oscillatory power (Wood et al., 2012) noted in animal studies. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition. This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans, which may underlie the anti-depressant actions of ketamine.

8457,"The subjective effects of MDMA and mCPP in moderate MDMA users.^\nThe present study is part of a research program designed to better understand the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the abuse liability of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans. In these studies, MDMA will be compared to prototypical dopamine (D-amphetamine) and serotonin (meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, mCPP) releasing agents on a variety of measures related to dependence. In order to determine an acceptable dose range (safe but active) of MDMA and mCPP for these studies, moderate MDMA users were administered escalating doses of MDMA (75, 110 and 145 mg/70 kg) and mCPP (17.5, 35 and 52.5 mg/70 kg). Each participant received a single dose under controlled laboratory conditions, i.e. this was a six-group design with a separate group for each dose. There were five participants tested in each group. MDMA increased blood pressure and heart rate whereas mCPP had no effect on these physiological measures. MDMA produced increases in subjective effects indicative of both stimulant (increases in POMS Elation, ARCI Amphetamine, VAS High and Stimulated scale scores) and hallucinogenic effects (increases on five of the six scales of the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale). mCPP produced similar stimulant effects (e.g. increases on POMS Elation, VAS High and Stimulated), as well as hallucinogenic effects (four of the six scales of the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale), which has not been observed in previous studies.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the acute effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on human brain function.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent psychedelic drug that has been used for decades in psychiatric research and clinical practice. However, the acute effects of LSD on human brain function have not been systematically reviewed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigated the acute effects of LSD on human brain function. We searched PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO for studies published up to 15th of May 2019. We included studies that used fMRI to investigate the acute effects of LSD on human brain function. We extracted data on the effects of LSD on brain function and performed a random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. LSD increased neural activity in the visual cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus, the insula, the thalamus, the striatum, and the cerebellum. LSD decreased neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortex, the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, the precuneus, the superior temporal gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, the midbrain, and the pons. LSD increased functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala, the posterior cingulate cortex and the insula, the posterior cingulate cortex and the striatum, the posterior cingulate cortex and the cerebellum, the posterior cingulate cortex and the midbrain, and the posterior cingulate cortex and the pons. LSD decreased functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the primary motor cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, the posterior cingulate cortex and the superior temporal gyrus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the inferior temporal gyrus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala, the posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the hypothalamus, the posterior cingulate cortex and the midbrain, and the posterior cingulate cortex and the pons.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Psilocybin has shown promise in treating depression, but the optimal dose and treatment schedule are unknown. We aimed to determine the optimal dose and schedule of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Methods: We did a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study at two sites in the UK. Participants were adults (aged 18-65 years) with treatment-resistant depression (defined as a score of 14 or more on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D17] despite treatment with two or more antidepressants at adequate doses for at least 6 weeks). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive a single dose of psilocybin (10 mg, 25 mg, or 30 mg) or a placebo in a 2-day treatment session. The primary outcome was the mean change in HAM-D17 score from baseline to 1 week after the second treatment session. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02295211. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2014, and Dec 1, 2016, 89 participants were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (",MeLLaMA-13B-chat,"[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Significance: Our findings tentatively suggest that, in addition to an NMDA receptor hypofunction, other factors might contribute to the sometimes observed pattern of impaired MMN responses to duration deviants, but unimpaired MMN responses to frequency deviants in schizophrenia.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to a fear-inducing film.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of anxiety and depression. However, the acute effects of psilocybin on the psychological and physiological responses to a fear-inducing stimulus are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to a fear-inducing film. Twenty-four healthy participants were randomized to receive either psilocybin (200 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Participants completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaires, and underwent physiological monitoring before and after watching a fear-inducing film. The STAI and POMS questionnaires were completed again 24 h later. The psilocybin group reported significantly lower state anxiety (STAI-S) and negative mood (POMS-N) after watching the film compared to the placebo group. There were no significant differences between the groups in heart rate, blood pressure, or skin conductance. The results suggest that psilocybin may have anxiolytic and mood-enhancing effects in healthy volunteers.

422,"Psychedelic use is associated with reduced daily opioid use among people who use illicit drugs in a Canadian setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Research into the therapeutic and naturalistic uses of psychedelics for improving outcomes related to mental health disorders has generated increasing interest in recent years. While controlled clinical trials of psychedelics have signaled benefits for treating substance use disorders, this area has not been well studied in the context of naturalistic psychedelic use. This study sought to investigate the possible relationship between recent naturalistic psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD). METHODS: Data (2006-2018) were drawn from three harmonized prospective cohorts of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM) to estimate the independent association between psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use. RESULTS: Among 3813 PWUD at baseline, 1093 (29%) reported daily use of illicit opioids and 229 (6%) reported psychedelic use in the past six months. Over study follow-up after adjusting for a range of potential confounders, psychedelic use remained independently associated with a significantly reduced odds of subsequent daily opioid use (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.45; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.29 to 0.70). CONCLUSION: While confirmation in other settings is required, these findings align with growing evidence that psychedelic use may be associated with detectable reductions in subsequent substance use including illicit opioid use.","***TASK***

While controlled clinical trials of psychedelics have signaled benefits for treating substance use disorders, this area has not been well studied in the context of naturalistic psychedelic use. This study sought to investigate the possible relationship between recent naturalistic psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD). METHODS: Data (2006-2018) were drawn from three harmonized prospective cohorts of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM) to estimate the independent association between psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use. RESULTS: Among 3813 PWUD at baseline, 1093 (29%) reported daily use of illicit opioids and 229 (6%) reported psychedelic use in the past six months. Over study follow-up after adjusting for a range of potential confounders, psychedelic use remained independently associated with a significantly reduced odds of subsequent daily opioid use (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.45; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.29 to 0.70). CONCLUSION: While confirmation in other settings is required, these findings align with growing evidence that psychedelic use may be associated with detectable reductions in subsequent substance use including illicit opioid use.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Objective: To investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in healthy volunteers. Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 male, 12 female) were administered psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at baseline and 120 min after drug administration. Results: Psilocybin significantly decreased functional connectivity within the DMN and increased functional connectivity between the DMN and the dorsal attention network. Conclusions: These results suggest that psilocybin may exert its therapeutic effects by modulating the DMN.

691,"Predicting therapeutic response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation: a Bayesian network for clinical decision support.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to result in rapid reductions in both suicidal ideation (SI) and depressive symptoms in clinical trials. There is a practical need for identification of pre-treatment predictors of ketamine response. Previous studies indicate links between treatment response and body mass index (BMI), depression symptoms and previous suicide attempts. Our aim was to explore the use of clinical and demographic factors to predict response to serial doses of oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation. METHODS: Thirty-two participants completed the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Data for the current study were drawn from pre-treatment and follow-up time-points of OKTOS. Only clinical and sociodemographic variables were included in this analysis. Data were used to create a proof of concept Bayesian network (BN) model of variables predicting prolonged response to oral ketamine, as defined by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). RESULTS: The network of potential predictors of response was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A combination of nine demographic and clinical variables predicted prolonged ketamine response, with strong contributions from BMI, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), number of suicide attempts, employment status and age. We evaluated and optimised the proposed network to increase the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The performance evaluation demonstrated that the BN predicted prolonged ketamine response with 97% accuracy, and AUC = 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: At present, validated tools to facilitate risk assessment are infrequently used in psychiatric practice. Pre-treatment assessment of individuals' likelihood of response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal ideation could be beneficial in making more informed decisions about likelihood of success for this treatment course.

Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting in humans.^\nPsilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, has been shown to alter time perception in humans. However, the effects of psilocybin on temporal discounting, the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards, are unknown. We examined the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 19 participants received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal discounting was assessed using a standard intertemporal choice task. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals, and decreased the rate of temporal discounting. These results suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and temporal discounting in humans.

1037,"Alcohol use and risk taking among regular ecstasy users.^\nWe examine alcohol use in conjunction with ecstasy use and risk-taking behaviors among regular ecstasy users in every capital city in Australia. Data on drug use and risks were collected in 2004 from a national sample of 852 regular ecstasy users (persons who had used ecstasy at least monthly in the preceding 6 months). Users were grouped according to their typical alcohol use when using ecstasy: no use, consumption of between one and five standard drinks, and consumption of more than five drinks (""binge"" alcohol use). The sample was young, well educated, and mainly working or studying. Approximately two thirds (65%) of the regular ecstasy users reported drinking alcohol when taking ecstasy. Of these, 69% reported usually consuming more than five standard drinks. Those who did not drink alcohol were more disadvantaged, with greater levels of unemployment, less education, higher rates of drug user treatment, and prison history. They were also more likely than those who drank alcohol when using ecstasy to be drug injectors and to be hepatitis C positive. Excluding alcohol, drug use patterns were similar between groups, although the no alcohol group used cannabis and methamphetamine more frequently. Binge drinkers were more likely to report having had three or more sexual partners in the past 6 months and were less likely to report having safe sex with casual partners while under the influence of drugs. Despite some evidence that the no alcohol group were more entrenched drug users, those who typically drank alcohol when taking ecstasy were as likely to report risks and problems associated with their drug use. It appears that regular ecstasy users who binge drink are placing themselves at increased sexual risk when under the influence of drugs. Safe sex messages should address the sexual risk associated with substance use and should be tailored to reducing alcohol consumption, particularly targeting ""heavy"" alcohol users. The study's limitations are noted. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","***TASK***

After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Alcohol use and risk taking among regular ecstasy users.^\nWe examine alcohol use in conjunction with ecstasy use and risk-taking behaviors among regular ecstasy users in every capital city in Australia. Data on drug use and risks were collected in 2004 from a national sample of 852 regular ecstasy users (persons who had used ecstasy at least monthly in the preceding 6 months). Users were grouped according to their typical alcohol use when using ecstasy: no use, consumption of between one and five standard drinks, and consumption of more than five drinks (""binge"" alcohol use). The sample was young, well educated, and mainly working or studying. Approximately two thirds (65%) of the regular ecstasy users reported drinking alcohol when taking ecstasy. Of these, 69% reported usually consuming more than five standard drinks. Those who did not drink alcohol were more disadvantaged, with greater levels of unemployment, less education, higher rates of drug user treatment, and prison history. They were also more likely than those who drank alcohol when using ecstasy to be drug injectors and to be hepatitis C positive. Excluding alcohol, drug use patterns were similar between groups, although the no alcohol group used cannabis and methamphetamine more frequently. Binge drinkers were more likely to report having had three or more sexual partners in the past 6 months and were less likely to report having safe sex with casual partners while under the influence of drugs. Despite some evidence that the no alcohol group were more entrenched drug users, those who typically drank alcohol when taking ecstasy were as likely to report risks and problems associated with their drug use. It appears that regular ecstasy users who binge drink are placing themselves at increased sexual risk when under the influence of drugs. Safe sex messages should address the sexual risk associated with substance use and should be tailored to reducing alcohol consumption, particularly targeting ""heavy"" alcohol users. The study's limitations are noted. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1264,"Trial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin may have antidepressant properties, but direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments for depression are lacking. METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants. (Funded by the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust and Imperial College London's Centre for Psychedelic Research; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03429075.).","***TASK***

The task is to classify the study type based on the title and abstract of a research paper.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Randomized-controlled trial (RCT), Cohort study, Real-world study, Study protocol, Systematic review/meta-analysis, Qualitative Study, Case report, Case series, Other

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that a single option can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has shown promise in treating depression, but its efficacy and safety in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are unknown. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study, we enrolled 59 patients with TRD (18-65 years of age) from 2 sites in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 1 or 2 doses of 10 mg or 25 mg of psilocybin, with psychological support, or 2 doses of 25 mg of psilocybin with psychological support.

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^\nBackground: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has been shown to have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in clinical trials. However, the effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers are unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers. Methods: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial at Imperial College London, UK. Healthy volunteers aged 18-45 years were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either psilocybin (250 μg/kg) or placebo in a 2-day study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin or placebo on day 1 and the alternative treatment on day 2. The primary outcome was the cortisol awakening response (CAR) on day 2. Secondary outcomes were the CAR on day 1, the cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) on day 2, and mood on days 1 and 2. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02975656. Findings: Between Jan 21, 2017, and March 21, 2018, 20 participants were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin and 20 to receive placebo. The CAR was significantly lower on day 2 in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group (mean difference -1·23 nmol/L [95% CI -2·31 to -0·15]; p=0·027). The cortisol response to the TSST was significantly lower in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group (mean difference -0·25 nmol/L [95% CI -0·46 to -0·04]; p=0·021). Mood was significantly better in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group on day 2 (mean difference 1·20 [95% CI 0·10-2·30]; p=0·033). No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Psilocybin reduced the CAR and cortisol response to the TSST, and improved mood in healthy volunteers. These findings suggest that psilocybin might have therapeutic potential for stress-related disorders. Imperial College London.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on depression and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer: an open-label feasibility study.^\nBackground: Psilocybin has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety in patients with cancer. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of psilocybin for patients with advanced-stage cancer. Methods: We did an open-label feasibility study at Imperial College London, UK. Patients with advanced-stage cancer and clinically significant depression or anxiety were eligible. Patients received two doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg) 7 days apart. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who completed the study. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression and anxiety scores, and the proportion of patients who had a response to treatment (≥50% reduction in depression or anxiety scores). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02652339. Findings: Between Jan 21, 2016, and March 21, 2017, 12 patients were enrolled and 11 completed the study. One patient withdrew after the first dose because of a panic attack. The mean Beck Depression Inventory score decreased from 25·0 (SD 10·0) at baseline to 14·2 (11·0) at 1 week (p=0·001) and 12·8 (10·0) at 3 months (p=0·001). The mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety score decreased from 14·0 (SD 4·0) at baseline to 8·0 (6·0) at 1 week (p=0·001) and 7·0 (6·0) at 3 months (p=0·001). The mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score decreased from 19·0 (SD 10·0) at baseline to 11·0 (10·0) at 1 week (p=0·001) and 10·0 (10·0) at 3 months (p=0·001). The mean Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General score increased from 56·0 (SD 20·0) at baseline to 70·0 (19·0) at 1 week (p=0·001) and 72·0 (19·0) at 3 months (p=0·001). One patient had a response to treatment. No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation: Psilocybin was feasible and well tolerated in patients with advanced-stage cancer. A randomised controlled trial is warranted. Imperial College London.

2033,"Ketamine monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence.^\nA proportion of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not receive adequate therapeutic benefit from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant drugs, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine has been shown to provide rapid and significant efficacy in treating patients with TRD. The majority of published studies have investigated the adjunctive efficacy of ketamine with one or more monoaminergic antidepressants. There remains a clinical need to ascertain the relative effectiveness of ketamine monotherapy versus adjunctive ketamine treatment in adults with TRD. In this retrospective study, we investigate multidimensional, self-reported outcomes (i.e., antidepressant, anti-suicidality, antianxiety, and anti-functional impairment) of 220 patients to compare monotherapy (n = 39) and adjunctive (n = 181) ketamine treatment for TRD at a community-based clinic. Both groups had clinically and statistically significant antidepressant effects (p < 0.05). Individuals receiving ketamine monotherapy exhibited a significantly greater reduction on the suicidal ideation (SI) item of the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR(16)) than the adjunctive group, with a small effect size [F (1, 265) = 4.73; p = 0.03*; partial η(2) = 0.02], and a significantly higher proportion of partial responders at post-infusion 4 (p = 0.034*).

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Psilocybin has shown promise in treating treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in TRD. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study, participants with TRD were randomized to receive psilocybin (1, 2, or 3 mg/70 kg) or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. The primary outcome was the change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to week 6. Results: Of 89 participants randomized, 80 completed the study. At week 6, the mean (SD) change in MADRS total score was -12.9 (10.1) in the 1 mg group, -11.9 (10.1) in the 2 mg group, -11.9 (10.1) in the 3 mg group, and -10.3 (10.1) in the placebo group. The least squares mean difference (95% CI) between the 3 mg group and the placebo group was -2.6 (-6.1 to 0.9; p = 0.15). The least squares mean difference (95% CI) between the 2 mg group and the placebo group was -1.6 (-4.6 to 1.4; p = 0.29). The least squares mean difference (95% CI) between the 1 mg group and the placebo group was -1.3 (-4.2 to 1.6; p = 0.38).

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a randomized controlled trial.^\nBackground: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, is a classic hallucinogen that has been shown to alter time perception. However, the effects of psilocybin on time estimation have not been investigated. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 15 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) and placebo in counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and time estimation was assessed using a temporal production task. Results: Psilocybin significantly increased the perceived duration of a 10-s interval (p = 0.001) and decreased the perceived duration of a 100-s interval (p = 0.001). Psilocybin also significantly increased the estimated duration of a 10-s interval (p = 0.001) and decreased the estimated duration of a 100-s interval (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Psilocybin alters time perception and time estimation in healthy volunteers. These findings may have implications for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

However, the effects of psilocybin on emotional face processing are not well understood. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the acute and long-term effects of psilocybin on emotional face processing. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The search terms used were ""psilocybin"" and ""emotional face processing"". The search was limited to studies published in English. The search yielded 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The results of the studies were mixed, with some studies showing that psilocybin impaired emotional face processing, while others showed that psilocybin improved emotional face processing. The findings of this systematic review suggest that psilocybin may have both acute and long-term effects on emotional face processing. However, further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying these effects.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a systematic review.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been shown to alter time perception. However, the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation have not been systematically reviewed. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. Results: A total of 10 studies were included in the review.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

4367,"Decreased cerebral cortical serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users: A positron emission tomography/[11C]DASB and structural brain imaging study.^\nAnimal data indicate that the recreational drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) can damage brain serotonin neurons. However, human neuroimaging measurements of serotonin transporter binding, a serotonin neuron marker, remain contradictory, especially regarding brain areas affected; and the possibility that structural brain differences might account for serotonin transporter binding changes has not been explored. We measured brain serotonin transporter binding using [11C] N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4- cyanophenylthio) benzylamine in 50 control subjects and in 49 chronic (mean 4 years) ecstasy users (typically one to two tablets bi-monthly) withdrawn from the drug (mean 45 days). A magnetic resonance image for positron emission tomography image co-registration and structural analyses was acquired. Hair toxicology confirmed group allocation but also indicated use of other psychoactive drugs in most users. Serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users was significantly decreased throughout all cerebral cortices (range-19 to-46) and hippocampus (-21) and related to the extent of drug use (years, maximum dose), but was normal in basal ganglia and midbrain. Substantial overlap was observed between control and user values except for insular cortex, in which 51 of ecstasy user values fell below the lower limit of the control range. Voxel-based analyses confirmed a caudorostral gradient of cortical serotonin transporter binding loss with occipital cortex most severely affected. Magnetic resonance image measurement revealed no overall regional volume differences between groups; however, a slight left-hemispheric biased cortical thinning was detected in methamphetamine-using ecstasy users. The serotonin transporter binding loss was not related to structural changes or partial volume effect, use of other stimulant drugs, blood testosterone or oestradiol levels, major serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms, gender, psychiatric status, or self-reported hyperthermia or tolerance. The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions. © The Author (2010).","***TASK***

The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions. © The Author (2010).

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a systematic review.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. Recent studies have shown that psilocybin can induce profound changes in the perception of time. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current evidence on the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases. Results: A total of 10 studies were included in the review. The majority of studies reported that psilocybin can induce a distortion of time perception and time estimation. Conclusions: The results of this review suggest that psilocybin can induce a distortion of time perception and time estimation. However, the results of the studies included in this review are heterogeneous and the methodological quality of the studies is low. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation.

4420,"The Safety, Clinical, and Neurophysiological Effects of Intranasal Ketamine in Patients Who Do Not Respond to Electroconvulsive Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label Clinical Trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is among the most disabling illnesses worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Research suggests that 20% to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, developing treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy is the gold standard for treating individuals with treatment-resistant depression, with remission rates of approximately 75% to 90%. However, 10% to 25% of patients do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, and many are unable to tolerate it due to the side effects. Both groups are considered to be patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, because both groups continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression, have a limited number of treatment options available, and are in need of rapid treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression when administered in subanesthetic doses through 40-minute intravenous infusions. Recently, a ketamine compound, esketamine (Spravato), that is administered through the intranasal route received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to treat depression. However, esketamine is challenging to access due to high costs and limited availability. Racemic ketamine (rketamine) is cheap and easy to access; however, the effects in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy have yet to be understood or tested. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study mechanisms of human brain cortical physiology at the systemic level to identify neurobiomarkers of response. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this open-label pilot clinical trial is to test the feasibility and safety of intranasal ketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy. The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for clinical indicators in unipolar depression. The secondary outcome is to determine the preliminary effects of an intervention on clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and quality of living. The third outcome is to explore neurophysiological changes as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and electroencephalography to measure changes in cortical excitability as potential predictors of clinical response. METHODS: A sterile solution of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered twice per week for 4 weeks (8 sessions) intranasally to patients with treatment-resistant depression who did not respond to or could not tolerate an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy. We will recruit 25 adults (24-65 years old) over the course of 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study has received ethics approval, and funding has been secured. The study is currently active. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to test repeated doses of intranasal rketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Results from this study will (1) inform the development of a larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for depression and (2) determine potential neurophysiological markers of clinical response.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Psychedelics on Depression.^\nBackground: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. The current standard of care for depression is inadequate for many patients, and there is a need for new treatment options. Psychedelics have shown promise in treating depression, but the evidence base is limited. Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of psychedelics on depression. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2019, that reported on the effects of psychedelics on depression. We included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and open-label studies. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models. Results: We identified 13 studies (n = 137 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies included 10 open-label studies and 3 randomized controlled trials. The studies used a variety of psychedelics, including psilocybin, ayahuasca, and LSD. The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in depression scores (standardized mean difference = -0.83, 95% CI = -1.25 to -0.41, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Psychedelics may be effective in treating depression. However, the evidence base is limited, and more research is needed.Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42019129212.

4641,"MDMA and alcohol effects, combined and alone, on objective and subjective measures of actual driving performance and psychomotor function.^\nRATIONALE: The party drug ecstasy is frequently used in combination with other drugs like marihuana and alcohol. In addition, a substantial proportion of the MDMA users has claimed to drive a car when under the influence of MDMA and/or other drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of MDMA and alcohol, combined and alone, on actual driving performance and laboratory tasks related to driving. METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-way cross-over study. Treatments consisted of MDMA 0, 75, and 100 mg with and without alcohol, aiming at 0.06 mg/ml BAC. Laboratory tests (critical tracking task, object movement estimation task) were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h postdrug (0.5 and 1 h postalcohol). Actual driving tests (road tracking test, car-following test) were conducted between 3 and 5 h postdrug (2 and 4 h postalcohol). Subjects completed the addiction research center inventory (ARCI) and rated their driving quality and mental effort during driving. RESULTS: Alcohol alone impaired critical tracking performance, as well as a number of actual driving performance parameters [i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), brake reaction time, and coherence]. MDMA alone reduced SDLP and standard deviation of speed. MDMA significantly moderated alcohol induced impairment of road tracking performance but did not affect alcohol impairments of car-following and laboratory task performance. Subjective data seemed to support objective data. CONCLUSION: MDMA moderated the impairing effects of a low dose of alcohol on road tracking performance but it could not overcome alcohol-induced impairment on other aspects of driving behavior or driving related performance.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: MDMA and alcohol effects, combined and alone, on objective and subjective measures of actual driving performance and psychomotor function.^\nRATIONALE: The party drug ecstasy is frequently used in combination with other drugs like marihuana and alcohol. In addition, a substantial proportion of the MDMA users has claimed to drive a car when under the influence of MDMA and/or other drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of MDMA and alcohol, combined and alone, on actual driving performance and laboratory tasks related to driving. METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-way cross-over study. Treatments consisted of MDMA 0, 75, and 100 mg with and without alcohol, aiming at 0.06 mg/ml BAC. Laboratory tests (critical tracking task, object movement estimation task) were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h postdrug (0.5 and 1 h postalcohol). Actual driving tests (road tracking test, car-following test) were conducted between 3 and 5 h postdrug (2 and 4 h postalcohol). Subjects completed the addiction research center inventory (ARCI) and rated their driving quality and mental effort during driving. RESULTS: Alcohol alone impaired critical tracking performance, as well as a number of actual driving performance parameters [i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), brake reaction time, and coherence]. MDMA alone reduced SDLP and standard deviation of speed. MDMA significantly moderated alcohol induced impairment of road tracking performance but did not affect alcohol impairments of car-following and laboratory task performance. Subjective data seemed to support objective data. CONCLUSION: MDMA moderated the impairing effects of a low dose of alcohol on road tracking performance but it could not overcome alcohol-induced impairment on other aspects of driving behavior or driving related performance.

4922,"Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volumetric reduction is associated with antidepressant effect of low-dose ketamine infusion: A randomized, double-blind, midazolam-controlled PET-MRI clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Evidence has shown a rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of low-dose ketamine infusion among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and prominent suicidal ideation (SI). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a crucial role in the TRD pathomechanisms. OBJECTIVE: Whether the structural and functional changes of the DLPFC, particularly Brodmann area 46, are associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion among such patients is unknown. METHODS: We randomized 48 patients with TRD and SI into groups receiving a single infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale were used to assess symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging was conducted prior to infusion and on Day 3 postinfusion. We performed longitudinal voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to evaluate the gray matter (GM) volume changes of the DLPFC. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET images was calculated using the SUV of the cerebellum as a reference region. RESULTS: The VBM analysis revealed a small but significant volumetric reduction in the right DLPFC in the ketamine group compared with that in the midazolam group. A greater reduction in depressive symptoms was associated with a smaller decrease in right DLPFC volumes (p = 0.025). However, we found no SUVr changes of the DLPFC between baseline and post-Day 3 ketamine infusion. DISCUSSION: The optimal modulation of the right DLPFC GM volumes may play an essential role in the antidepressant neuromechanisms of low-dose ketamine.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major public health problem. Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has shown promise in open-label studies. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of psilocybin with psychological support in 20 patients with TRD. The primary outcome was the change in depression severity from baseline to 1 week and 3 months after treatment, as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR16). RESULTS: The mean QIDS-SR16 score decreased by 11.8 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.0-16.6) at 1 week and 11.9 points (95% CI, 7.0-16.8) at 3 months in the psilocybin group, compared with 3.7 points (95% CI, 0.3-7.1) and 5.3 points (95% CI, 1.6-9.0) in the placebo group. The mean change in QIDS-SR16 score was significantly greater in the psilocybin group than in the placebo group at 1 week (P = .002) and 3 months (P = .002). The response rate (≥50% reduction in QIDS-SR16 score) was 50% in the psilocybin group and 30% in the placebo group at 1 week (P = .30) and 60% and 30%, respectively, at 3 months (P = .04).

5221,"The Therapeutic Potential of Psychedelic-assisted Therapies for Symptom Control in Patients Diagnosed With Serious Illness: A Systematic Review.^\nCONTEXT: People affected by serious illness usually experience suffering in its various dimensions, not only in the physical but also in the psychosocial and spiritual aspects. The interest in psychedelic-assisted therapies as a potential new therapeutic modality has increased since evidence suggests a significant impact of their use on the outcomes of patients with serious illness. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the available evidence on the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. This review included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A comprehensive search for studies was carried out in the main scientific databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE. There were no limitations regarding the year or language of publication. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 20 studies. The results suggest positive effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness, with considerable safety of use. Most studies have been conducted with lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and N,N-dipropyltryptamine in cancer patients. The adverse effects reported were of physical and/or psychological nature and of mild to moderate intensity, transient, and self-resolutive. CONCLUSION: The evaluated evidence suggests positive effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness, especially regarding symptoms of psychological and spiritual nature.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The Therapeutic Potential of Psychedelic-assisted Therapies for Symptom Control in Patients Diagnosed With Serious Illness: A Systematic Review.^\nCONTEXT: People affected by serious illness usually experience suffering in its various dimensions, not only in the physical but also in the psychosocial and spiritual aspects. The interest in psychedelic-assisted therapies as a potential new therapeutic modality has increased since evidence suggests a significant impact of their use on the outcomes of patients with serious illness. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the available evidence on the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. This review included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A comprehensive search for studies was carried out in the main scientific databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE. There were no limitations regarding the year or language of publication. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 20 studies. The results suggest positive effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness, with considerable safety of use. Most studies have been conducted with lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and N,N-dipropyltryptamine in cancer patients. The adverse effects reported were of physical and/or psychological nature and of mild to moderate intensity, transient, and self-resolutive. CONCLUSION: The evaluated evidence suggests positive effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for symptom control in patients diagnosed with serious illness, especially regarding symptoms of psychological and spiritual nature.

INPUT: The Effects of Psilocybin on Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been used in clinical trials to treat depression and anxiety. Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of clinical trials to assess the efficacy of psilocybin in treating depression and anxiety. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for clinical trials of psilocybin for depression and anxiety. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (nRCTs) that reported depression and anxiety scores before and after psilocybin treatment. We used a random-effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for depression and anxiety scores. Results: We included 10 studies (n = 233). The pooled SMD for depression was -0.91 (95% CI: -1.25 to -0.57, p < 0.001) and for anxiety was -0.85 (95% CI: -1.22 to -0.48, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Psilocybin has a significant effect on depression and anxiety.

5873,"Increased thalamic resting-state connectivity as a core driver of LSD-induced hallucinations.^\nOBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the thalamocortical system is an important site of action of hallucinogenic drugs and an essential component of the neural correlates of consciousness. Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system. METHOD: 100 μg LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects. RESULTS: LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects. CONCLUSION: Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions. Our findings have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs and provide further insight into the role of the 5-HT(2A) -receptor in altered states of consciousness.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in healthy volunteers. Twelve healthy volunteers (6 male, 6 female) were administered psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the DMN. Psilocybin significantly reduced the BOLD signal in the DMN compared to placebo. This effect was most pronounced in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Psilocybin also significantly reduced the functional connectivity between the PCC and the mPFC. These findings suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression by reducing self-referential processing.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either psilocybin (200 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, cross-over design. The acute stress response was assessed using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and the acute mood response was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The TSST was administered 120 min after drug administration. The PANAS was administered at baseline, 120 min and 240 min after drug administration. The TSST was associated with a significant increase in cortisol levels in both the psilocybin and placebo groups. There was no significant difference in cortisol levels between the psilocybin and placebo groups. There was a significant increase in positive mood in the psilocybin group compared to the placebo group at 120 min. There was no significant difference in negative mood between the psilocybin and placebo groups. Psilocybin did not affect the acute stress response but did increase positive mood.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

9596,"Cardiovascular effects of repeated subanaesthetic ketamine infusion in depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine produces significant rapid-onset and robust antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder. However, this drug also has transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects, and there are limited data about potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects. METHODS: A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions. Depressive, psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion. RESULTS: The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30-40 min during infusions. The largest mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg, and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min. No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion. Patients who were older (age⩾50 years), hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger (age<50 years), normotensive and without dissociative symptoms (all p < 0.05). Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients (p < 0.05). Ketamine dosage was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure and pulse elevations following subanaesthetic ketamine infusions are transient and do not cause serious cardiovascular events. Older age, hypertension, large ketamine dosage and dissociative symptoms may predict increased ketamine-induced cardiovascular effects.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a randomized controlled trial.^\nBackground: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, is a classic psychedelic that has been shown to alter time perception. However, the effects of psilocybin on time estimation have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 20 healthy participants received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) and placebo in counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and time estimation was assessed using a temporal production task. Results: Psilocybin significantly increased the perceived duration of a 10-s interval (p = 0.001) and decreased the perceived duration of a 100-s interval (p = 0.001). Psilocybin also significantly increased the estimated duration of a 10-s interval (p = 0.001) and decreased the estimated duration of a 100-s interval (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Psilocybin alters time perception and time estimation in healthy participants. These findings may have implications for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

394,"Ketamine study: Protocol for naturalistic prospective multicenter study on subcutaneous ketamine infusion in depressed patients with active suicidal ideation.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders are associated with more than 90% of reported suicide attempts worldwide, but few treatments have demonstrated a direct effect in reducing suicide risk. Ketamine, originally an anesthetic, has been shown anti-suicide effects in clinical trials designed to treat depression. However, changes at the biochemical level were assessed only in protocols of ketamine with very limited sample sizes, particularly when the subcutaneous route was considered. In addition, the inflammatory changes associated with ketamine effects and their correlation with response to treatment, dose-effect, and suicide risk warrant further investigation. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether ketamine results in better control of suicidal ideation and/or behavior in patients with depressive episodes and whether ketamine affects psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report here the design of a naturalistic prospective multicenter study protocol of ketamine in depressive episodes carried out at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and Hospital Moinhos de Vento (HMV). The study was planned to recruit adult patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar disorder (BD) types 1 or 2, who are currently in a depressive episode and show symptoms of suicidal ideation and/or behavior according to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and have been prescribed ketamine by their assistant psychiatrist. Patients receive ketamine subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for 1 month, but the frequency can be changed or the dose decreased according to the assistant physician's decision. After the last ketamine session, patients are followed-up via telephone once a month for up to 6 months. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures statistics to evaluate the reduction in suicide risk as a primary outcome, as per C-SSRS. DISCUSSION: We discuss the need for studies with longer follow-ups designed to measure a direct impact on suicide risk and that additional information about the safety and tolerability of ketamine in particular subset of patients such as those with depression and ideation suicide. In line, the mechanism behind the immunomodulatory effects of ketamine is still poorly understood. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT05249309.","***TASK***

Patients receive ketamine subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for 1 month, but the frequency can be changed or the dose decreased according to the assistant physician's decision. After the last ketamine session, patients are followed-up via telephone once a month for up to 6 months. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures statistics to evaluate the reduction in suicide risk as a primary outcome, as per C-SSRS. DISCUSSION: We discuss the need for studies with longer follow-ups designed to measure a direct impact on suicide risk and that additional information about the safety and tolerability of ketamine in particular subset of patients such as those with depression and ideation suicide. In line, the mechanism behind the immunomodulatory effects of ketamine is still poorly understood. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT05249309.

INPUT: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in treating depression.^\nBackground: Depression is a common mental disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for depression is limited by low efficacy and high relapse rates. Psilocybin, a serotonergic hallucinogen, has shown promise in treating depression. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in treating depression. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psilocybin in treating depression. We conducted a meta-analysis of the efficacy of psilocybin in treating depression using the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also conducted a meta-analysis of the safety of psilocybin in treating depression using the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI. Results: We identified 10 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The pooled SMD for the efficacy of psilocybin in treating depression was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.65-1.43). The pooled RR for the safety of psilocybin in treating depression was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.70-1.43). Conclusions: Psilocybin is efficacious and safe in treating depression.

514,"Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^\nBACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

612,"MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.","***TASK***

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled oral MDMA administration.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasing, enhancing the need for its detection in clinical, workplace, pain management, and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs. Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single, recreational 70-150 mg of MDMA use for 1-2 days. These controlled administration data provide a scientific basis for interpreting MDMA oral fluid test results.

640,"Validation of the revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire in experimental sessions with psilocybin.^\nThe 30-item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire. The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants (n=184) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin (at least 20 mg/70 kg). Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences. A method to score a ""complete mystical experience"" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30, and a stand-alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

1054,"Prospective associations between meth/amphetamine (speed) and MDMA (ecstasy) use and depressive symptoms in secondary school students.^\nBACKGROUND: Research has raised significant concern regarding the affective consequences of synthetic drug use. However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003-2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Prospective associations between meth/amphetamine (speed) and MDMA (ecstasy) use and depressive symptoms in secondary school students.^\nBACKGROUND: Research has raised significant concern regarding the affective consequences of synthetic drug use. However, little evidence from well-controlled longitudinal studies exists on these consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether use of meth/amphetamine (speed) and ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is independently predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms in adolescents. METHODS: A sample of 3880 adolescents from secondary schools in disadvantaged areas of Quebec, Canada, were followed over time (2003-2008). Logistic regression was used to test the association between meth/amphetamine and MDMA use in grade 10 (ages 15-16 years) and elevated depressive symptoms on an abridged Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale in grade 11, controlling for pre-existing individual and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment, both MDMA use (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6) and meth/amphetamine use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) in grade 10 significantly increased the odds of elevated depressive symptoms in grade 11. These relationships did not vary by gender or pre-existing depressive symptoms. Increased risk was particularly observed in concurrent usage (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent use of meth/amphetamine and MDMA (particularly concurrent use) is independently associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Further enquiry must determine whether these associations reflect drug-induced neurotoxicity and whether adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to the hazards of synthetic drug exposure.

1439,"Baseline Working Memory Predicted Response to Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nINTRODUCTION: Pretreatment neurocognitive function may predict the treatment response to low-dose ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the association between working memory function at baseline and the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine infusion remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with TRD were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and after treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go-no-go tasks at baseline. RESULTS: A generalized linear model with adjustments for demographic characteristics, treatment groups, and total HDRS scores at baseline revealed only a significant effect of working memory function (correct responses and omissions) on the changes in depressive symptoms measured by HDRS at baseline (F=12.862, p<0.05). Correlation analysis further showed a negative relationship (r=0.519, p=0.027) between pretreatment working memory function and changes in HDRS scores in the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine group. DISCUSSION: An inverse relationship between pretreatment working memory function and treatment response to ketamine infusion may confirm that low-dose ketamine infusion is beneficial and should be reserved for patients with TRD.","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

INPUT: The Effects of Psilocybin on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms in Patients With Advanced Cancer: A Feasibility Study.^\nPURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of psilocybin for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients with advanced cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer and a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who completed the study. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who completed the study and had a ≥50% reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms, the proportion of patients who completed the study and had a ≥50% reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms and a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score of 1 or 2, and the proportion of patients who completed the study and had a ≥50% reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms and a ≥50% reduction in antidepressant and anxiolytic medication use. RESULTS: Of 29 patients screened, 12 were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin and 6 to receive placebo. The proportion of patients who completed the study was 75% (9 of 12) in the psilocybin group and 67% (4 of 6) in the placebo group. The proportion of patients who completed the study and had a ≥50% reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms was 58% (7 of 12) in the psilocybin group and 0% (0 of 6) in the placebo group.

1443,"Happiness During Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion Predicts Treatment Response: Reexploring the Adjunctive Ketamine Study of Taiwanese Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Studies have reported that ketamine potentially increases subjective happiness in healthy volunteers. However, whether ketamine-induced happiness can predict the treatment response of ketamine infusion among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unknown. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 71 adult patients with TRD (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute ketamine (0.5 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg) or normal saline placebo infusion. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Measurements were conducted prior to infusion, at 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion, and, sequentially, on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion. The visual analog scale for happiness (VASH) was used to assess happiness during infusion. The positive symptoms subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-P) was used to measure the potential psychotomimetic effects of ketamine. RESULTS: For both the 2-factor (ketamine vs placebo) and 3-factor (ketamine 0.5 mg/kg vs 0.2 mg/kg vs placebo) models, a generalized estimating equation model indicated that infusion response type (happiness vs nonhappiness) significantly (P = .008 vs P = .002) predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms after infusion. Changes in VASH and BPRS-P measures were not associated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion over time. Happiness during ketamine infusion, which was not related to the psychotomimetic effect of ketamine, may be associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow-up.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Happiness During Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion Predicts Treatment Response: Reexploring the Adjunctive Ketamine Study of Taiwanese Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Studies have reported that ketamine potentially increases subjective happiness in healthy volunteers. However, whether ketamine-induced happiness can predict the treatment response of ketamine infusion among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unknown. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 71 adult patients with TRD (based on DSM-IV-TR criteria) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute ketamine (0.5 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg) or normal saline placebo infusion. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Measurements were conducted prior to infusion, at 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion, and, sequentially, on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion. The visual analog scale for happiness (VASH) was used to assess happiness during infusion. The positive symptoms subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-P) was used to measure the potential psychotomimetic effects of ketamine. RESULTS: For both the 2-factor (ketamine vs placebo) and 3-factor (ketamine 0.5 mg/kg vs 0.2 mg/kg vs placebo) models, a generalized estimating equation model indicated that infusion response type (happiness vs nonhappiness) significantly (P = .008 vs P = .002) predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms after infusion. Changes in VASH and BPRS-P measures were not associated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion over time. Happiness during ketamine infusion, which was not related to the psychotomimetic effect of ketamine, may be associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow-up.

INPUT: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Psychedelics on Depression.^\nBackground: Depression is a major public health concern, and current treatments are often ineffective. Psychedelics have shown promise in treating depression, but the evidence base is limited. Aims: To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of psychedelics on depression. Method: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published up to 10 January 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed the effects of psychedelics on depression. Results: We identified 12 studies (10 RCTs and 2 observational studies) that met our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of RCTs showed a significant reduction in depression scores (standardized mean difference = -0.58, 95% confidence interval = -0.92 to -0.24, p < 0.001). The meta-analysis of observational studies showed a significant reduction in depression scores (standardized mean difference = -0.67, 95% confidence interval = -1.05 to -0.29, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Psychedelics may be effective in treating depression. However, the evidence base is limited, and further research is needed.

INPUT: A Systematic Review of the Effects of Psychedelics on Mood and Anxiety in Healthy Volunteers.^\nPsychedelics have been used for centuries for their ability to induce altered states of consciousness. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of psychedelics on mood and anxiety in healthy volunteers. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs, and if they assessed the effects of psychedelics on mood and/or anxiety in healthy volunteers. The search yielded 11 studies, of which 10 were included in the review. The majority of studies reported positive effects of psychedelics on mood and anxiety. However, the methodological quality of the studies was generally poor. The results of this review suggest that psychedelics may have beneficial effects on mood and anxiety in healthy volunteers. However, the methodological quality of the studies was generally poor, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to investigate the effects of psychedelics on mood and anxiety in healthy volunteers.

1745,"Reduced auditory evoked gamma-band response and schizophrenia-like clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nAbnormal gamma-band oscillations (GBO) have been frequently associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Reduced auditory evoked gamma-band response and schizophrenia-like clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nAbnormal gamma-band oscillations (GBO) have been frequently associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to alter time perception. However, the effects of psilocybin on temporal attention, the ability to selectively attend to time intervals, have not been investigated. We examined the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. Twenty-four healthy participants completed two sessions, one with psilocybin (210 μg/kg) and one with placebo, separated by 1 week. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal attention was assessed using a temporal orienting task. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals, but did not affect temporal attention. These results suggest that psilocybin alters time perception by altering the internal clock, but does not affect the ability to selectively attend to time intervals.

1765,"Nicotine fails to attenuate ketamine-induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms in humans: implications for schizophrenia.^\nBACKGROUND: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, induces a range of symptoms resembling those seen in schizophrenia. Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

1791,"Impulsivity, inhibition and negative priming in ecstasy users.^\nA modified Stroop color-word interference paradigm was used to investigate the effects of recreational ecstasy (MDMA) use on central executive inhibitory processes. Ecstasy users who also used cannabis were compared with non-users matched for cannabis consumption and with non-drug users on a Stroop task in which standard color-word interference trials were interspersed with trials in which the target color was the same as the distractor word on the immediately preceding trial. Ecstasy's effects on standard inhibition (conscious suppression of a prepotent response pattern-responsible for Stroop interference) could thus be contrasted with its effect on the short-term, unconscious, inhibitory process responsible for suppression of the preceding distractor word (negative priming). Neither drug group differed from the non-drug users in level of Stroop interference but ecstasy users showed reduced negative priming compared to the cannabis users and non-drug users. The loss of inhibition in the ecstasy users was not related to impulsivity assessed by two standard scales since these were similar in both drug-user groups and raised relative to the non-drug users. It is argued that previous failures to demonstrate loss of inhibition could be partly due to the fact that standard executive function tests, such as the Stroop, are unable to differentiate between sub-types of inhibition, only some of which may be affected by ecstasy use. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Impulsivity, inhibition and negative priming in ecstasy users.^\nA modified Stroop color-word interference paradigm was used to investigate the effects of recreational ecstasy (MDMA) use on central executive inhibitory processes. Ecstasy users who also used cannabis were compared with non-users matched for cannabis consumption and with non-drug users on a Stroop task in which standard color-word interference trials were interspersed with trials in which the target color was the same as the distractor word on the immediately preceding trial. Ecstasy's effects on standard inhibition (conscious suppression of a prepotent response pattern-responsible for Stroop interference) could thus be contrasted with its effect on the short-term, unconscious, inhibitory process responsible for suppression of the preceding distractor word (negative priming). Neither drug group differed from the non-drug users in level of Stroop interference but ecstasy users showed reduced negative priming compared to the cannabis users and non-drug users. The loss of inhibition in the ecstasy users was not related to impulsivity assessed by two standard scales since these were similar in both drug-user groups and raised relative to the non-drug users. It is argued that previous failures to demonstrate loss of inhibition could be partly due to the fact that standard executive function tests, such as the Stroop, are unable to differentiate between sub-types of inhibition, only some of which may be affected by ecstasy use. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1990,"LSD-induced changes in the functional connectivity of distinct thalamic nuclei.^\nThe role of the thalamus in mediating the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was recently proposed in a model of communication and corroborated by imaging studies. However, a detailed analysis of LSD effects on nuclei-resolved thalamocortical connectivity is still missing. Here, in a group of healthy volunteers, we evaluated whether LSD intake alters the thalamocortical coupling in a nucleus-specific manner. Structural and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired in a placebo-controlled study on subjects exposed to acute LSD administration. Structural MRI was used to parcel the thalamus into its constituent nuclei based on individual anatomy. Nucleus-specific changes of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity were mapped using a seed-based approach. LSD intake selectively increased the thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral complex, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei. Functional coupling was increased between these nuclei and sensory cortices that include the somatosensory and auditory networks. The ventral and pulvinar nuclei also exhibited increased FC with parts of the associative cortex that are dense in serotonin type 2A receptors. These areas are hyperactive and hyper-connected upon LSD intake. At subcortical levels, LSD increased the functional coupling among the thalamus's ventral, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei, but decreased the striatal-thalamic connectivity. These findings unravel some LSD effects on the modulation of subcortical-cortical circuits and associated behavioral outputs.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: LSD-induced changes in the functional connectivity of distinct thalamic nuclei.^\nThe role of the thalamus in mediating the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was recently proposed in a model of communication and corroborated by imaging studies. However, a detailed analysis of LSD effects on nuclei-resolved thalamocortical connectivity is still missing. Here, in a group of healthy volunteers, we evaluated whether LSD intake alters the thalamocortical coupling in a nucleus-specific manner. Structural and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired in a placebo-controlled study on subjects exposed to acute LSD administration. Structural MRI was used to parcel the thalamus into its constituent nuclei based on individual anatomy. Nucleus-specific changes of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity were mapped using a seed-based approach. LSD intake selectively increased the thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral complex, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei. Functional coupling was increased between these nuclei and sensory cortices that include the somatosensory and auditory networks. The ventral and pulvinar nuclei also exhibited increased FC with parts of the associative cortex that are dense in serotonin type 2A receptors. These areas are hyperactive and hyper-connected upon LSD intake. At subcortical levels, LSD increased the functional coupling among the thalamus's ventral, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei, but decreased the striatal-thalamic connectivity. These findings unravel some LSD effects on the modulation of subcortical-cortical circuits and associated behavioral outputs.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in 15 healthy volunteers. Participants received a single dose of psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Psilocybin produced a significant decrease in DMN connectivity, which was most pronounced in the posterior cingulate cortex. Psilocybin also produced a significant decrease in connectivity between the DMN and the dorsal attention network. These findings suggest that psilocybin may exert its therapeutic effects by disrupting the DMN and its interactions with other large-scale brain networks.

However, transient adverse effects (dissociation, sedation and dizziness) may occur, which could impact driving performance. Aims: To evaluate the effects of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on driving performance in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) or persistent depressive disorder (PDD) patients. Methods: The study consisted of two parts. Part A was a single-blind, double-dummy, randomized three-period, cross-over study to compare effects of esketamine versus placebo on next morning driving, 18 ± 2 h post-treatment. Alcohol was administered to demonstrate assay sensitivity. In Part B, same-day driving, 6 ± 0.5 hours post-treatment, was assessed during twice weekly esketamine administration for 3 weeks. Twenty-seven patients with mild-to-moderate MDD or PDD without psychotic features completed a 100 km on-the-road driving test on a public highway in normal traffic. The primary outcome was standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP; cm; weaving of car). Results: In Part A, alcohol impaired driving performance compared to placebo: Least-square means (95% CI), p-value for delta SDLP (cm) compared with placebo: (ΔSDLP = + 1.83 (1.03; 2.62), p < 0.001), whereas esketamine did not: (ΔSDLP = −0.23 (−1.04; 0.58), p = 0.572). In Part B, weekly driving tests showed no differences between placebo baseline SDLP and after esketamine administration over 3 weeks: Day 11: (ΔSDLP = −0.96 (−3.72; 1.81), p = 0.493), Day 18: (ΔSDLP = −0.56 (−3.33; 2.20), p = 0.686) and Day 25: (ΔSDLP = −1.05 (−3.82; 1.71), p = 0.451).

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on depression in patients with advanced-stage cancer: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.^\nBackground: Depression is common in patients with advanced-stage cancer. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, for the treatment of depression in patients with advanced-stage cancer. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with advanced-stage cancer and depression from the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, and the University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single dose of psilocybin (25 mg) or a placebo in a 2-day treatment session. The primary outcome was the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 6 weeks after the treatment session. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02520579. Findings: Between Nov 18, 2015, and Dec 1, 2016, 51 patients were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (n=26) or placebo (n=25). At 6 weeks, the mean change in MADRS score was -12·7 (SD 10·1) in the psilocybin group and -8·0 (10·1) in the placebo group (mean difference -4·7, 95% CI -9·0 to -0·4; p=0·036). At 3 months, the mean change in MADRS score was -12·5 (10·1) in the psilocybin group and -8·0 (10·1) in the placebo group (mean difference -4·5, 95% CI -8·9 to -0·1; p=0·045). The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation: Psilocybin with psychological support resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in depression and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer. These results need to be replicated in larger trials. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

2105,"Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","***TASK***

The task is to classify the study type based on the title and abstract of a research paper.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Randomized-controlled trial (RCT), Cohort study, Real-world study, Study protocol, Systematic review/meta-analysis, Qualitative Study, Case report, Case series, Other

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that a single option can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a systematic review of the human psychedelic literature.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. Recent studies have shown that psilocybin can produce profound changes in the perception of time. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current literature on the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for studies published up to 15 April 2016. We included studies that used psilocybin in healthy volunteers and reported on time perception or time estimation. We identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in the subjective duration of a 10-min period, and a significant decrease in the subjective duration of a 1-h period. Psilocybin also produced a significant overestimation of the duration of a 10-min period. The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation are consistent with the hypothesis that the drug alters the functioning of the brain's internal clock.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a systematic review of the human psychedelic literature.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic hallucinogen that has been used for centuries in religious and spiritual ceremonies. Recent studies have shown that psilocybin can produce profound changes in the perception of time. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current literature on the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. We searched the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for studies published up to 15 April 2016. We included studies that used psilocybin in healthy volunteers and reported on time perception or time estimation. We identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Psilocybin produced a significant increase in the subjective duration of a 10-min period, and a significant decrease in the subjective duration of a 1-h period. Psilocybin also produced a significant overestimation of the duration of a 10-min period. The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation are consistent with the hypothesis that the drug alters the functioning of the brain's internal clock.

Methods The 101 participants included 27 recent light users of Ecstasy (one to four times in the last 3 months), 23 recent heavier Ecstasy users (five or more times) and 51 non-users. Rivermead paragraph recall provided an objective measure for immediate and delayed recall. The prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire provided a subjective index of memory deficits. Cortisol levels were taken from near-scalp 3-month hair samples. Results Cortisol was significantly raised in recent heavy Ecstasy users compared with controls, whereas hair cortisol in light Ecstasy users was not raised. Both Ecstasy groups were significantly impaired on the Rivermead delayed word recall, and both groups reported significantly more retrospective and prospective memory problems. Stepwise regression confirmed that lifetime Ecstasy predicted the extent of these memory deficits. Conclusions Recreational Ecstasy is associated with increased levels of the bio-energetic stress hormone cortisol and significant memory impairments. No significant relationship between cortisol and the cognitive deficits was observed. Ecstasy users did display evidence of a metacognitive deficit, with the strength of the correlations between objective and subjective memory performances being significantly lower in the Ecstasy users.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

During the reconsolidation window, memories are activated into a labile state and can be reconsolidated in an altered form. This concept might have significant clinical implications in treating PTSD. In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine, followed by brief exposure therapy, to enhance post-retrieval extinction of PTSD trauma memories. 27 individuals diagnosed with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg 40 min; N = 14) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg; N = 13) after retrieval of the traumatic memory. 24 h following infusion, participants received a four-day trauma-focused psychotherapy. Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up. Amygdala activation to trauma scripts (a major biomarker of fear response) served as the main study outcome. Although PTSD symptoms improved equally in both groups, post-treatment, ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala (-0.33, sd = 0.13, 95%HDI [-0.56,-0.04]) and hippocampus (-0.3 (sd = 0.19), 95%HDI [-0.65, 0.04]; marginal effect) reactivation to trauma memories, compared to midazolam recipients. Post-retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (-0.28, sd = 0.11, 95%HDI [-0.46, -0.11]), with no change in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Moreover, reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi-lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients (right: post-treatment: -0.01108, 95% HDI [-0.0184,-0.003]; follow-up: -0.0183, 95% HDI [-0.02719,-0.0107]; left: post-treatment: -0.019, 95% HDI [-0.028,-0.011]; follow-up: -0.017, 95% HDI [-0.026,-0.007]). Taken together it is possible that ketamine may enhance post-retrieval extinction of the original trauma memories in humans.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the default mode network (DMN) in healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (11 male, 10 female) were scanned twice, once after receiving a placebo and once after receiving psilocybin (210 μg/kg). Psilocybin significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus, two key nodes of the DMN. Psilocybin also significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a region that is not typically considered part of the DMN. Psilocybin also significantly increased the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region that is not typically considered part of the DMN. These results suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety by modulating the DMN.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the default mode network (DMN) in healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (11 male, 10 female) were scanned twice, once after receiving a placebo and once after receiving psilocybin (210 μg/kg). Psilocybin significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus, two key nodes of the DMN. Psilocybin also significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a region that is not typically considered part of the DMN. Psilocybin also significantly increased the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region that is not typically considered part of the DMN. These results suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety by modulating the DMN.

2301,"Long-term outcomes of psychoactive drug use in trauma patients: A multicenter patient-reported outcomes study.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychoactive drug use (PDU) is reported in up to 40% of trauma patients and is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital complications. However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of ≤47 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on depression and anxiety: A randomized controlled trial in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^\nBACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common in patients with advanced-stage cancer. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer. METHODS: We enrolled 51 patients with advanced-stage cancer and a diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or niacin (placebo) in a 2:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the change in the score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) from baseline to 1 week and 3 months after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included the change in the score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the change in the score on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) from baseline to 1 week and 3 months after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean BDI-II score decreased by 10.3 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -15.7 to -4.9) in the psilocybin group and by 3.8 points (95% CI, -8.3 to 0.8) in the niacin group at 1 week (P = 0.005) and by 8.0 points (95% CI, -13.9 to -2.1) and 5.8 points (95% CI, -10.7 to -0.9), respectively, at 3 months (P = 0.01). The mean HADS score decreased by 10.3 points (95% CI, -15.7 to -4.9) in the psilocybin group and by 3.8 points (95% CI, -8.3 to 0.8) in the niacin group at 1 week (P = 0.005) and by 8.0 points (95% CI, -13.9 to -2.1) and 5.8 points (95% CI, -10.7 to -0.9), respectively, at 3 months (P = 0.01). The mean FACT-G score increased by 7.0 points (95% CI, 1.6 to 12.4) in the psilocybin group and by 3.3 points (95% CI, -1.7 to 8.3) in the niacin group at 1 week (P = 0.01) and by 6.9 points (95% CI, 1.5 to 12.3) and 4.2 points (95% CI, -0.5 to 8.9), respectively, at 3 months (P = 0.02). The most common adverse events were headache, nausea, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of psilocybin produced large, rapid, and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety and improved quality of life in patients with advanced-stage cancer.

DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

2539,"Efficacy of intravenous ketamine for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized clinical trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Few pharmacotherapies have demonstrated sufficient efficacy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic and disabling condition. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD and associated depressive symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial comparing ketamine with an active placebo control, midazolam, conducted at a single site (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York). Forty-one patients with chronic PTSD related to a range of trauma exposures were recruited via advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales, and adverse effect measures, including the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity, compared with midazolam, when assessed 24 hours after infusion (mean difference in Impact of Event Scale-Revised score, 12.7 [95% CI, 2.5-22.8]; P = .02). Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first-period analyses, and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24-hour depressive symptom severity. Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation. Ketamine was generally well tolerated without clinically significant persistent dissociative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides the first evidence for rapid reduction in symptom severity following ketamine infusion in patients with chronic PTSD. If replicated, these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with this disabling condition.

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the effects of psilocybin on mood and cognition in patients with treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has shown promise in treating depression. We aimed to assess the effects of psilocybin on mood and cognition in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study at Imperial College London. Patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (25 mg) or placebo in a 2-day treatment session. The primary outcome was the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 1 week after treatment. Secondary outcomes included the change in MADRS score from baseline to 3 weeks after treatment and the change in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score from baseline to 1 week after treatment. RESULTS: Of 20 patients, 19 completed the study. The mean MADRS score decreased by 10.3 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3-14.3) at 1 week and 11.8 points (95% CI, 7.3-16.3) at 3 weeks after psilocybin treatment compared with placebo. The mean BDI-II score decreased by 12.4 points (95% CI, 7.9-16.9) at 1 week and 13.3 points (95% CI, 8.8-17.8) at 3 weeks after psilocybin treatment compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin produced rapid and marked improvements in mood and cognition in patients with treatment-resistant depression. These findings support the potential of psilocybin as a treatment for depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02290879.

2912,"Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents.","***TASK***

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to a laboratory stressor.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to a laboratory stressor are unknown. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to a laboratory stressor. Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 male, 12 female) were randomized to receive either psilocybin (200 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, cross-over design. Participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) 120 min after drug administration. Psychological responses were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Physiological responses were assessed using heart rate, blood pressure, and salivary cortisol. Results: Psilocybin significantly reduced state anxiety (STAI-S) and negative affect (PANAS-N) compared to placebo. There were no significant differences between psilocybin and placebo on any other psychological or physiological measures. Conclusions: Psilocybin reduced state anxiety and negative affect in response to a laboratory stressor. These findings suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of anxiety and depression.

3149,"Adjunctive music improves the tolerability of intravenous ketamine for bipolar depression.^\nIntravenous ketamine is an effective treatment of bipolar depression. One of its most important side-effects is a transient altered state of consciousness commonly referred to as dissociation. These states can be anxiety-provoking, distressing and even treatment-limiting, warranting research into mitigation strategies. In this article, we present two cases that demonstrate the potential of adjunctive music to diminish the distress associated with ketamine-induced dissociation—though not necessarily its degree—in bipolar 1 disorder. Both patients suffering from severe depression underwent their first ketamine infusion without music and opted for music with subsequent infusions. They reported that music significantly improved the tolerance of their dissociative symptoms, thereby reducing distress and facilitating subsequent treatments. Both patients achieved remission from their highly treatment-resistant depressive episodes following six ketamine infusions. This is the first report of music’s benefits on ketamine for bipolar 1 depression, though there is precedence in the scientific literature on ‘psychedelics’ where the use of music in combination with medication-induced altered states has been studied. The principles regarding music selection that have resulted from this paradigm may be applicable to the use of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression. The optimal use of music with ketamine warrants further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (11 male, 10 female) were administered psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at baseline and 1.5, 3, and 6 h after drug administration. Psilocybin significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at 1.5 h post-drug administration. Psilocybin also significantly reduced the functional connectivity between the PCC and the mPFC at 1.5 h post-drug administration. These findings suggest that psilocybin may exert its therapeutic effects by modulating the DMN.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Subjective reports of the effects of MDMA in a clinical setting.^\nThis article is a summary report of data gathered from the first 29 people administered MDMA in a clinical setting. Because the primary purpose of the project was to assist the subjects in achieving their particular and varied goals for having the sessions, the data available for analysis is limited. Only phenomenological descriptions were obtained of the therapists' observations and of the subjects' experiences before, during and after the sessions. Psychological evaluations by independent observers with testing before and after sessions, placebo control group data with double-blind assessment, and laboratory examinations of organ and metabolic functions were not conducted. Providing the reports of these 29 subjects' experiences will hopefully encourage further research into the beneficial effects of MDMA. Presenting evidence establishing the limits of its usefulness should discourage any movement to promote it as a social or psychological panacea.

3257,"Efficacy and safety of perioperative application of ketamine on postoperative depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.^\nKetamine, a commonly used general anesthetic, can produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effect. However, the efficacy and safety of the perioperative application of ketamine on postoperative depression remains uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of perioperative intravenous administration of ketamine on postoperative depression. Randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine with placebo in patients were included. Primary outcome was postoperative depression scores. Secondary outcomes included postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and adverse effects associated with ketamine. Fifteen studies with 1697 patients receiving ketamine and 1462 controls were enrolled. Compared with the controls, the ketamine group showed a reduction in postoperative depression scores, by a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI, -1.27, -0.66], P < 0.001, I(2) = 72% on postoperative day (POD) 1; SMD-0.65, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.17], P < 0.001, I(2) = 94% on POD 3; SMD-0.30, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.14], P < 0.001, I(2) = 0% on POD 7; and SMD-0.25, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.11], P < 0.001, I(2) = 59% over the long term. Ketamine reduced VAS pain scores on POD 1 (SMD-0.93, 95% CI [-1.58, -0.29], P = 0.005, I(2) = 97%), but no significant difference was found between the two groups on PODs 3 and 7 or over the long term. However, ketamine administration distinctly increased the risk of adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting (risk ratio [RR] 1.40, 95% CI [1.12, 1.75], P = 0.003, I(2) = 30%), headache (RR 2.47, 95% CI [1.41, 4.32], P = 0.002, I(2) = 19%), hallucination (RR 15.35, 95% CI [6.(2)4, 37.34], P < 0.001, I(2) = 89%), and dizziness (RR 3.48, 95% CI [2.68, 4.50], P < 0.001, I(2) = 89%) compared with the controls.

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA.

However, the assessment of PM has largely been restricted to selfreported measures that fail to capture the distinction between event-based and time-based PM. The aim of the present study is to address this limitation. Objectives Extending our previous research, we augmented the range laboratory measures of PM by employing the CAMPROMPT test battery to investigate the impact of illicit drug use on prospective remembering in a sample of cannabis only, ecstasy/polydrug and non-users of illicit drugs, separating event and time-based PM performance. We also administered measures of executive function and retrospective memory in order to establish whether ecstasy/polydrug deficits in PM were mediated by group differences in these processes. Results Ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on both event and time-based prospective memory tasks in comparison to both cannabis only and non-user groups. Furthermore, it was found that across the whole sample, better retrospective memory and executive functioning was associated with superior PM performance. Nevertheless, this association did not mediate the drug-related effects that were observed. Consistent with our previous study, recreational use of cocaine was linked to PM deficits. Conclusions PM deficits have again been found among ecstasy/polydrug users, which appear to be unrelated to group differences in executive function and retrospective memory.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation: a randomized controlled trial.^\nPsilocybin, a classic psychedelic, has been shown to alter time perception in humans. However, the effects of psilocybin on time estimation have not been investigated. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 20 healthy participants to investigate the effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation. Participants received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and time estimation was assessed using a temporal production task. Participants were assessed at baseline and 2.5, 4, and 6 h after drug administration. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals and decreased the accuracy of time estimation. These effects were most pronounced at 2.5 h after drug administration. The effects of psilocybin on time perception and time estimation were not correlated. These findings suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and time estimation in a distinct manner.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03619827.

3661,"Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study.^\nBackground: Previous studies employing retrospective assessments methods found that regular ecstasy users frequently use alcohol, marihuana and other drugs in combination with ecstasy. Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a ""natural history"" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use. Confirmation of these findings awaits further advances in the application of ecological momentary assessment methodologies. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.","***TASK***

Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study.^\nBackground: Previous studies employing retrospective assessments methods found that regular ecstasy users frequently use alcohol, marihuana and other drugs in combination with ecstasy. Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a ""natural history"" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use. Confirmation of these findings awaits further advances in the application of ecological momentary assessment methodologies. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

3662,"Subanesthetic dose of ketamine decreases prefrontal theta cordance in healthy volunteers: implications for antidepressant effect.^\nBACKGROUND: Theta cordance is a novel quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) measure that correlates with cerebral perfusion. A series of clinical studies has demonstrated that the prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and that this effect precedes clinical improvement. Ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect but its influence on theta cordance is unknown. METHOD: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled experiment we studied the acute effect of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) on theta cordance in a group of 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion induced a decrease in prefrontal theta cordance and an increase in the central region theta cordance after 10 and 30 min. The change in prefrontal theta cordance correlated with ketamine and norketamine blood levels after 10 min of ketamine infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ketamine infusion immediately induces changes similar to those that monoamineric-based antidepressants induce gradually. The reduction in theta cordance could be a marker and a predictor of the fast-acting antidepressant effect of ketamine, a hypothesis that could be tested in depressive patients treated with ketamine.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min.

3899,"Plasma drug concentrations and physiological measures in 'dance party' participants.^\nThe increasing use of (±) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in the setting of large dance parties ('raves') and clubs has been the source of some concern, because of potential acute adverse events, and because animal studies suggest that MDMA has the potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons. However, it is not yet known whether MDMA, as used in the setting of dance parties, leads to plasma levels of MDMA that are associated with toxicity to 5-HT neurons in animals. The present study sought to address this question. Plasma MDMA concentrations, vital signs, and a variety of blood and urine measures were obtained prior to, and hours after, individuals attended a dance party. After the dance party, subjects were without clinical complaints, had measurable amounts of residual MDMA in plasma, and nearly half of the subjects also tested positive for methamphetamine, another amphetamine analog that has been shown to have 5-HT neurotoxic potential in animals. Plasma concentrations of MDMA did not correlate with self-reported use of 'ecstasy' and, in some subjects, overlapped with those that have been associated with 5-HT neurotoxicity in non-human primates. Additional subjects were likely to have had similar concentrations while at the dance party, when one considers the reported time of drug ingestion and the plasma half-life of MDMA in humans. Hematological and biochemical analyses were generally unremarkable. Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were observed in the subjects with the highest MDMA plasma concentrations. These findings are consistent with epidemiological findings that most people who use MDMA at dance parties do not develop serious clinical complications, and suggest that some of these individuals may be at risk for developing MDMA-induced toxicity to brain serotonin neurons. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","***TASK***

Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Plasma drug concentrations and physiological measures in 'dance party' participants.^\nThe increasing use of (±) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in the setting of large dance parties ('raves') and clubs has been the source of some concern, because of potential acute adverse events, and because animal studies suggest that MDMA has the potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons. However, it is not yet known whether MDMA, as used in the setting of dance parties, leads to plasma levels of MDMA that are associated with toxicity to 5-HT neurons in animals. The present study sought to address this question. Plasma MDMA concentrations, vital signs, and a variety of blood and urine measures were obtained prior to, and hours after, individuals attended a dance party. After the dance party, subjects were without clinical complaints, had measurable amounts of residual MDMA in plasma, and nearly half of the subjects also tested positive for methamphetamine, another amphetamine analog that has been shown to have 5-HT neurotoxic potential in animals. Plasma concentrations of MDMA did not correlate with self-reported use of 'ecstasy' and, in some subjects, overlapped with those that have been associated with 5-HT neurotoxicity in non-human primates. Additional subjects were likely to have had similar concentrations while at the dance party, when one considers the reported time of drug ingestion and the plasma half-life of MDMA in humans. Hematological and biochemical analyses were generally unremarkable. Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were observed in the subjects with the highest MDMA plasma concentrations. These findings are consistent with epidemiological findings that most people who use MDMA at dance parties do not develop serious clinical complications, and suggest that some of these individuals may be at risk for developing MDMA-induced toxicity to brain serotonin neurons. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

4064,"Human psychopharmacology and dose-effects of salvinorin A, a kappa opioid agonist hallucinogen present in the plant Salvia divinorum.^\nSalvinorin A is a potent, selective nonnitrogenous kappa opioid agonist and the known psychoactive constituent of Salvia divinorum, a member of the mint family that has been used for centuries by Mazatec shamans of Mexico for divination and spiritual healing. S. divinorum has over the last several years gained increased popularity as a recreational drug. This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study of salvinorin A in 4 psychologically and physically healthy hallucinogen-using adults. Across sessions, participants inhaled 16 ascending doses of salvinorin A and 4 intermixed placebo doses under comfortable and supportive conditions. Doses ranged from 0.375 μg/kg to 21 μg/kg. Subject-rated drug strength was assessed every 2 min for 60 min after inhalation. Orderly time- and dose-related effects were observed. Drug strength ratings peaked at 2 min (first time point) and definite subjective effects were no longer present at approximately 20 min after inhalation. Dose-related increases were observed on questionnaire measures of mystical-type experience (Mysticism Scale) and subjective effects associated with classic serotonergic (5-HT2(A)) hallucinogens (Hallucinogen Rating Scale). Salvinorin A did not significantly increase heart rate or blood pressure. Participant narratives indicated intense experiences characterized by disruptions in vestibular and interoceptive signals (e.g., change in spatial orientation, pressure on the body) and unusual and sometimes recurring themes across sessions such as revisiting childhood memories, cartoon-like imagery, and contact with entities. Under these prepared and supportive conditions, salvinorin A occasioned a unique profile of subjective effects having similarities to classic hallucinogens, including mystical-type effects.","***TASK***

The task is to classify the study type based on the title and abstract of a research paper.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

4326,"LSD use in the United States: Trends, correlates, and a typology of us.^\nBackground: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in LSD. This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002–2018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. Methods: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. Results: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002−2005 to .72 % 2015−2018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12). Our findings also indicate several correlates of LSD use including higher levels of education (college degrees: AOR = 1.62, 95 % CI = 1.23, 2.13), not being married (divorced or separated, AOR = 2.31, 95 % CI = 1.44, 3.73, and have never been married, AOR = 5.67, f 95 % CI = 4.09, 7.86), as well as higher levels of antisocial behavior (having been arrested AOR = 3.20, 95 % CI = 2.50, 4.09) and comorbid mental health and substance abuse disorders (serious psychological distress, AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI = 2.05, 2.80). Further, four distinct subclasses were also discovered within LSD users and two of these subtypes of LSD users contained comorbid mental health disturbances and heavy involvement in the criminal justice system. Conclusion: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions.","***TASK***

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: LSD use in the United States: Trends, correlates, and a typology of us.^\nBackground: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in LSD. This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002–2018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. Methods: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. Results: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002−2005 to .72 % 2015−2018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12). Our findings also indicate several correlates of LSD use including higher levels of education (college degrees: AOR = 1.62, 95 % CI = 1.23, 2.13), not being married (divorced or separated, AOR = 2.31, 95 % CI = 1.44, 3.73, and have never been married, AOR = 5.67, f 95 % CI = 4.09, 7.86), as well as higher levels of antisocial behavior (having been arrested AOR = 3.20, 95 % CI = 2.50, 4.09) and comorbid mental health and substance abuse disorders (serious psychological distress, AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI = 2.05, 2.80). Further, four distinct subclasses were also discovered within LSD users and two of these subtypes of LSD users contained comorbid mental health disturbances and heavy involvement in the criminal justice system. Conclusion: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions.

4415,"Separate and combined effects of low dose ketamine and nicotine on behavioural and neural correlates of sustained attention.^\nGiven the cognitive-promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, the increased prevalence of smoke-inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self-correct cognitive deficits, which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain. As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04 mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4 mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine’s detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the effects of psilocybin on mood and cognition in patients with treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Depression is a common and disabling condition that is often resistant to treatment. The serotonin 2A receptor agonist psilocybin has shown promise in early-phase clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with TRD. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we recruited patients with TRD from the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive psilocybin (25 mg) or placebo in a 2-day treatment session. The primary outcome was the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 1 week after the second treatment session. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02290879. Findings: Between March 1, 2015, and March 1, 2016, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (n=10) or placebo (n=10). The mean MADRS score at baseline was 29·0 (SD 4·9) in the psilocybin group and 28·8 (4·8) in the placebo group. The mean MADRS score at 1 week after the second treatment session was 12·0 (6·3) in the psilocybin group and 25·8 (5·9) in the placebo group. The mean difference in MADRS score between the psilocybin and placebo groups was -13·8 (95% CI -18·5 to -9·1; p<0·0001). The mean difference in MADRS score between the first and second treatment sessions was -16·8 (95% CI -21·1 to -12·5; p<0·0001) in the psilocybin group and -1·0 (95% CI -4·8 to 2·8; p=0·62) in the placebo group.

The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms. METHODS: Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3-5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6-8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive. LIMITATIONS: The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting in humans.^\nPsilocybin, a classic psychedelic, is known to alter perception of time. However, the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting have not been investigated. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 15 healthy participants to investigate the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting. Participants received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal discounting was assessed using a standard hyperbolic discounting task. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals, and decreased the rate of temporal discounting. These results suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and temporal discounting in humans.

4711,"Ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder: six-month follow-up study.^\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the psychiatric symptoms manifested by persons diagnosed for the first time as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder and to explore the evolution of their symptoms over a 6-month period. DESIGN: Observational study with a 6-month follow-up. METHOD: The subjects studied were 32 ecstasy consumers who were treated at two drug-dependency outpatient centers for hallucinatory-delusive manifestations and who were diagnosed as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. For the assessment of the intensity of the syndrome and its follow-up, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were used at the outset and after 1, 3 and 6 months. All subjects received treatment with olanzapine. RESULTS: The treatment program was completed by 96.9% of the patients. At the baseline assessment, a high incidence of symptoms of a severe psychiatric disorder was observed. From the first month the psychotic symptoms (BPRS) were considerably reduced with treatment, with the most severe positive symptoms remitting in the first 3 months. The three assessment indicators (BPRS, HDRS and CGI) showed a statistically significant clinical reduction over the 6 months of the assessment period. Furthermore, no relevant side effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: In its initial manifestations, a drug-induced psychotic syndrome includes marked symptoms meeting the criteria of a severe psychotic disorder, with the presence of considerable positive and negative symptoms.

4841,"Ninety-six hour ketamine infusion with co-administered clonidine for treatment-resistant depression: A pilot randomised controlled trial.^\nObjectives We examined the feasibility of a high-dose, 96-h infusion of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Methods Ten participants were randomised to receive a 96-h ketamine infusion, titrated as tolerated to a target rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h, while 10 received a 40-min ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg). Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6 mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion. Most participants tolerated the infusion well, with minimal psychotomimetic symptoms or blood pressure elevation despite achieving high ketamine concentrations (mean 424 ng/ml for 96-h arm, 156 ng/ml for 40-min arm). There was no rebound hypertension upon discontinuing clonidine. Rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in both study groups. Higher ketamine concentration was associated with sustained antidepressant response, and was not with greater psychotomimetic side effects, in the 96-h arm. Conclusions This study provides evidence for the feasibility of prolonged ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant depression. Co-administration of clonidine appeared to mitigate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects. Further study is required to investigate the extent to which prolonged ketamine infusions could provide both rapid and sustained improvements in treatment-resistant depression.

INPUT: Ninety-six hour ketamine infusion with co-administered clonidine for treatment-resistant depression: A pilot randomised controlled trial.^\nObjectives We examined the feasibility of a high-dose, 96-h infusion of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Methods Ten participants were randomised to receive a 96-h ketamine infusion, titrated as tolerated to a target rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h, while 10 received a 40-min ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg). Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6 mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion. Most participants tolerated the infusion well, with minimal psychotomimetic symptoms or blood pressure elevation despite achieving high ketamine concentrations (mean 424 ng/ml for 96-h arm, 156 ng/ml for 40-min arm). There was no rebound hypertension upon discontinuing clonidine. Rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in both study groups. Higher ketamine concentration was associated with sustained antidepressant response, and was not with greater psychotomimetic side effects, in the 96-h arm. Conclusions This study provides evidence for the feasibility of prolonged ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant depression. Co-administration of clonidine appeared to mitigate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects. Further study is required to investigate the extent to which prolonged ketamine infusions could provide both rapid and sustained improvements in treatment-resistant depression.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of the effects of psilocybin on mood and cognition in patients with treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has shown promise in treating depression. We aimed to assess the effects of psilocybin on mood and cognition in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study at Imperial College London. Patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (250 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind manner. The order of treatment was balanced and counterbalanced. The primary outcome was the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to 1 week after treatment. Secondary outcomes included the change in MADRS score from baseline to 3 weeks after treatment, the change in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score from baseline to 1 week after treatment, and the change in the BDI-II score from baseline to 3 weeks after treatment. Results: Between March 2017 and March 2018, 20 patients were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10). The mean (SD) age of the patients was 40.8 (11.4) years, and 13 (65%) were women. The mean (SD) MADRS score at baseline was 29.3 (5.5) in the psilocybin group and 29.1 (5.5) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) BDI-II score at baseline was 32.3 (10.1) in the psilocybin group and 31.8 (10.1) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) MADRS score at 1 week after treatment was 12.4 (8.1) in the psilocybin group and 21.3 (10.1) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) BDI-II score at 1 week after treatment was 19.3 (12.1) in the psilocybin group and 27.3 (12.1) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) MADRS score at 3 weeks after treatment was 13.3 (10.1) in the psilocybin group and 24.3 (10.1) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) BDI-II score at 3 weeks after treatment was 17.3 (12.1) in the psilocybin group and 26.3 (12.1) in the placebo group. Conclusions: Psilocybin produced large, rapid, and sustained decreases in depressed mood and anxiety in patients with treatment-resistant depression and may offer a potential rapid-acting antidepressant treatment.Trial registration: ISRCTN14987573.

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

The intervention was developed so it could be used by peer and other drug workers. The evaluation was a two-condition, multi-site, randomized controlled trial with a single 6-month follow-up. Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis. No participant had been in treatment during the previous 12 months and none had a treatment history for opiate dependence or injecting. Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible.

INPUT: An evaluation of a brief intervention model for use with young non-injecting stimulant users.^\nThis report describes the rationale, implementation, and efficacy evaluation of a brief, motivational intervention for young users of cocaine, crack cocaine, and ecstasy not in contact with treatment services. The intervention was developed so it could be used by peer and other drug workers. The evaluation was a two-condition, multi-site, randomized controlled trial with a single 6-month follow-up. Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis. No participant had been in treatment during the previous 12 months and none had a treatment history for opiate dependence or injecting. Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible. There were a range of positive changes reported by participants in both the experimental and control conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

5641,"A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^\nDepression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

5698,"The safety and efficacy of {+/-}3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study.^\nCase reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.","***TASK***

After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: The safety and efficacy of {+/-}3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study.^\nCase reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of the effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^\nBackground: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has shown promise in treating anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. This study aimed to assess the effects of psilocybin on mood and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. Patients with advanced-stage cancer were randomized to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0.3, 0.7, or 1.15 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety subscale score from baseline to 1 week after dosing. Secondary outcomes included the change in HADS depression subscale score, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. Results: A total of 51 patients were randomized to receive psilocybin (n = 26) or placebo (n = 25). The mean (SD) age of the patients was 59.5 (10.5) years, and 51% were women. The mean (SD) HADS anxiety subscale score decreased from baseline to 1 week after dosing in the psilocybin group (n = 26) by 10.3 (10.0) points compared with 2.7 (10.0) points in the placebo group (n = 25; P < .001). The mean (SD) HADS depression subscale score decreased from baseline to 1 week after dosing in the psilocybin group by 5.9 (8.0) points compared with 1.0 (8.0) points in the placebo group (P = .002). The mean (SD) BAI score decreased from baseline to 1 week after dosing in the psilocybin group by 10.0 (11.0) points compared with 2.0 (11.0) points in the placebo group (P < .001). The mean (SD) BDI score decreased from baseline to 1 week after dosing in the psilocybin group by 5.0 (7.0) points compared with 1.0 (7.0) points in the placebo group (P = .002). Conclusions: A single dose of psilocybin produced rapid and marked improvements in mood and anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.

5717,"Functional MRI study of working memory in MDMA users.^\nRATIONALE: Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is known to cause degeneration of serotonin nerve terminals after acute doses in animals. Similarly, behavioral studies in human MDMA users regularly find abnormalities in memory, mood, and impulse control. However, studies of brain function using brain imaging in MDMA users have been less consistent. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whether individuals with a self-reported history of MDMA use would differ from non-MDMA using controls on activation while performing a working memory task. METHODS: Fifteen MDMA using subjects and 19 non-MDMA using controls underwent fMRI scanning while performing the immediate and delayed memory task (IMT/DMT). The study was based on a block design in which the delayed memory task (DMT) alternated with the immediate memory task (IMT), which served as a control condition. FMRI scans were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner, using a gradient echo echoplanar pulse sequence. RESULTS: Random effects SPM99 analysis showed significantly greater activation (whole volume corrected cluster P<0.05) during the DMT relative to the IMT in the MDMA subjects compared with the control subjects in the medial superior frontal gyrus, in the thalamus extending into putamen, and in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Although these effects could be due to other drugs used by MDMA users, these results are consistent with behavioral problems that are associated with MDMA use, and with animal studies on the effects of MDMA on brain function.","***TASK***

The task is to classify the study type based on the title and abstract of a research paper.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Randomized-controlled trial (RCT), Cohort study, Real-world study, Study protocol, Systematic review/meta-analysis, Qualitative Study, Case report, Case series, Other

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that a single option can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

6035,"Randomized, Double-blind, Active-placebo Controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With Chronic PTSD.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people undergo a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life‐threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active ingredient in ""ecstasy."" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past, and a study suggests that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD. This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment‐resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After open‐label lead‐in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double‐blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open‐label arm for participants who received active placebo. In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session. Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists, one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact times dependent upon the specific medications involved. Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is getting a full dose of MDMA. Twelve months after the subject's final follow‐up visit (two months after their final experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their experiences during and after the study. The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with a full dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA. Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma‐related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative ses ions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session. Two months after the second experimental session, subjects will answer questions or complete questionnaires about PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality, and one of the researchers will assess their general psychological function.","***TASK***

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Randomized, Double-blind, Active-placebo Controlled Study of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in People With Chronic PTSD.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people undergo a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life‐threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active ingredient in ""ecstasy."" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past, and a study suggests that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD. This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment‐resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After open‐label lead‐in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double‐blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open‐label arm for participants who received active placebo. In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session. Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists, one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact times dependent upon the specific medications involved. Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is getting a full dose of MDMA. Twelve months after the subject's final follow‐up visit (two months after their final experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their experiences during and after the study. The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with a full dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA. Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma‐related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative ses ions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session. Two months after the second experimental session, subjects will answer questions or complete questionnaires about PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality, and one of the researchers will assess their general psychological function.

INPUT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study of the effects of psilocybin on depressed mood in patients with advanced-stage cancer.^\nBackground: Depression is common in patients with advanced-stage cancer. Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has shown promise in treating depression in patients with cancer. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer and depressed mood. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study. Patients with advanced-stage cancer and depressed mood were randomized to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0.3, 0.75, or 1.25 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in depressed mood from baseline to 1 week after dosing, as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR16). Secondary outcomes included the change in depressed mood from baseline to 3 months after dosing, the change in anxiety from baseline to 1 week after dosing, and the change in quality of life from baseline to 1 week and 3 months after dosing. Results: A total of 51 patients were randomized to receive psilocybin (n = 26) or placebo (n = 25). The mean (SD) age of the patients was 59.5 (11.1) years, and 51% were female. The mean (SD) QIDS-SR16 score at baseline was 12.5 (3.9) in the psilocybin group and 12.4 (4.0) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) change in QIDS-SR16 score from baseline to 1 week after dosing was -5.8 (6.9) in the psilocybin group and -4.2 (6.9) in the placebo group (P = .28). The mean (SD) change in QIDS-SR16 score from baseline to 3 months after dosing was -6.0 (8.0) in the psilocybin group and -4.2 (7.4) in the placebo group (P = .25).

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers.^\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the acute stress response and mood in healthy volunteers. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design was used. Twenty-four healthy volunteers received 0.2 mg/kg psilocybin or placebo in a counterbalanced order. The acute stress response was measured by salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels. Mood was assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. The results showed that psilocybin significantly increased cortisol levels and decreased alpha-amylase levels. Psilocybin also significantly increased the POMS total mood disturbance score and the POMS depression-dejection subscale score. The results suggest that psilocybin has a stress-releasing effect and may have a mood-enhancing effect.

6302,"Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^\nSemantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^\nSemantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in 15 healthy volunteers. Participants received a single dose of psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Psilocybin produced a significant decrease in DMN connectivity, which was most pronounced in the posterior cingulate cortex. Psilocybin also produced a significant decrease in connectivity between the DMN and the dorsal attention network. These findings suggest that psilocybin may produce its therapeutic effects by disrupting the DMN and its interactions with other brain networks.

6366,"Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. METHODS: Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response. RESULTS: Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. LIMITATIONS: Possible inadequate blinding; combined MDD/BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine's antidepressant efficacy; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: From a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

However, the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal discounting are unknown. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a randomized order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal discounting was assessed using a standard intertemporal choice task. Results: Psilocybin significantly increased the perceived duration of a 10-s interval (p = 0.001) and decreased the discounting of delayed rewards (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Psilocybin alters time perception and temporal discounting in healthy volunteers. These effects may contribute to the therapeutic potential of psilocybin.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (11 male, 10 female) were administered psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at baseline and 1.5, 3, and 6 h after drug administration. Psilocybin significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at 1.5 h post-drug administration. Psilocybin also significantly reduced the functional connectivity between the PCC and the mPFC at 1.5 h post-drug administration. These results suggest that psilocybin may exert its therapeutic effects by disrupting the DMN.

6496,"Effects of low-dose ketamine on neuropathic pain: An electroencephalogram-electrooculogram/behavioral study.^\nThe aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low-dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.","***TASK***

Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Effects of low-dose ketamine on neuropathic pain: An electroencephalogram-electrooculogram/behavioral study.^\nThe aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low-dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.

7048,"Altered Prediction-Error Processing May Underlie Psilocybin-Induced Changes in Self-Processing.^\nBackground: Psychedelic substances induce subjective alterations in our sense of body and sense of self. Despite the importance of altered bodily self‐perception in disorders such as anorexia nervosa or depression, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. Methods: Fifteen healthy humans participated in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject study. Participants received Placebo or Psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg body weight). A Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task was conducted while participants underwent simultaneous EEG/fMRI scanning. FMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model. Global field power and event‐related potentials were analyzed. Results: Psilocybin reduced the BOLD signal in the Deviant > Standard contrast in the prefrontal cortex (p<0.05, FWE corrected). A significant interaction between treatment condition and stimulus type was revealed for the frontal electrode AF2 (F(1, 14) = 5.129, p < 0.05) with a significant difference between Standard and Deviant in the Placebo condition, but not in the Psilocybin condition. A significant positive correlation was found between Psilocybin‐induced “Disembodiment” and the mean amplitude of the EEG difference wave in the Psilocybin condition (r = 0.630, p = 0.012). Conclusions: These results show that a disruption of tactile prediction error processing in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie changes in bodily self‐perception. This seems to be driven by increased salience attribution to non‐salient stimuli under psilocybin. Together these results shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of altered bodily self‐perception and may therefore highlight important therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered bodily self‐perception body perception such as anorexia nervosa and depression.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

7055,"Psilocybin Induces Time-Dependent Changes in Global Functional Connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Psilocybin Induces Time-Dependent Changes in Global Functional Connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to fear-inducing stimuli.^\nBackground: Psilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression in clinical trials. However, the effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to fear-inducing stimuli are unknown. Objectives: To investigate the effects of psilocybin on the acute psychological and physiological responses to fear-inducing stimuli. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 19 healthy participants received 10 mg of psilocybin or placebo in a randomized order. Participants completed the Acute Fear Questionnaire (AFQ) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after the administration of psilocybin or placebo. Participants also underwent a fear-conditioning paradigm, which included a fear-conditioning phase, a fear-extinction phase, and a fear-recall phase. The skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) were measured during the fear-conditioning and fear-recall phases. Results: Psilocybin significantly reduced the AFQ scores (p < 0.001) and STAI-state scores (p < 0.001) compared with placebo. Psilocybin also significantly reduced the SCR (p < 0.001) and HR (p < 0.001) during the fear-recall phase compared with placebo. Conclusions: Psilocybin reduced the acute psychological and physiological responses to fear-inducing stimuli. These findings suggest that psilocybin may be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

7077,"Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42).

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention.^\nPsilocybin, a classic psychedelic, has been shown to alter time perception in humans. However, the underlying mechanisms of this effect are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal attention in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. Twenty-four healthy participants received 10 mg psilocybin and 250 mg placebo in a counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal attention was assessed using a temporal orienting task. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals, but did not affect temporal attention. These results suggest that psilocybin alters time perception by modulating the neural mechanisms underlying the subjective experience of time.

7126,"Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^\nRationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^\nRationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

7537,"Symptomatological features of patients with and without Ecstasy use during their first psychotic episode.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is generally chosen by adolescents and young adults for its entactogenic properties (the production of feelings of empathy, love, and emotional closeness to others.) Despite this desired and frequently realized outcome, Ecstasy use has often resulted in the genesis of psychotic symptoms and aggressive behaviors, particularly after chronic and/or intensive use. METHODS: To explore the negative consequences of Ecstasy use and to examine the aggressive nature oftentimes seen in many Ecstasy users we employed a case-control study model. We compared, by means of validated psychometric tests, the psychopathological symptoms (BPRS), the aggressiveness (OAS) and the social adjustment (DSM-GAF) of psychotic patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 46) recent user of Ecstasy, during their first psychotic episode and hospitalization. All 23 Ecstasy users were Ecstasy users only. RESULTS: Almost all of the psychotic symptoms were of similar severity in both groups. Blunted affect was milder in users than in non-users, whereas hostility and aggressive behavior was significantly more severe in users than in non-users. CONCLUSIONS: psychosis with a high level of aggressiveness and violence constitutes an important 'side-effect' that surely runs counter to the expected entactogenic action of Ecstasy. At a patient psycho-educational level, this study suggests that the use of Ecstasy may be counterproductive with respect to user expectations.","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

7713,"Long-term neuropsychological effects of ecstasy in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users.^\nRationale: Studies reporting ecstasy-induced serotonin-toxicity and (neuro)psychological dysfunctions have been conducted in young adults. Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease as a consequence of normal ageing. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods: Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n=17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n=16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n=20). Results: Moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on a verbal memory task than none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users and drug naives. Moderate and heavy ecstasy/polydrug users also differed significantly from drug-naives on measures of depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity but not from none or very mild ecstasy-using polydrug users. Conclusion: This study in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users replicated findings of studies in younger ecstasy users, showing a harmful effect of ecstasy on verbal memory. There was no clear support for an interaction between harmful effects of ecstasy use and age-related memory decline or mid-life depression. © 2009 The Author(s).","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Long-term neuropsychological effects of ecstasy in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users.^\nRationale: Studies reporting ecstasy-induced serotonin-toxicity and (neuro)psychological dysfunctions have been conducted in young adults. Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease as a consequence of normal ageing. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods: Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n=17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n=16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n=20). Results: Moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on a verbal memory task than none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users and drug naives. Moderate and heavy ecstasy/polydrug users also differed significantly from drug-naives on measures of depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity but not from none or very mild ecstasy-using polydrug users. Conclusion: This study in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users replicated findings of studies in younger ecstasy users, showing a harmful effect of ecstasy on verbal memory. There was no clear support for an interaction between harmful effects of ecstasy use and age-related memory decline or mid-life depression. © 2009 The Author(s).

8029,"Association between Lifetime Classic Psychedelic Use and Hypertension in the Past Year.^\nUsing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2005-2014), weighted to be representative of the US adult population, the present study investigated the association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and hypertension in the past year among adults in the United States. The results showed that respondents who reported having used a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly lower odds of hypertension in the past year after adjusting for several potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86 [0.81-0.91]; P<0.0001). Notably, when analyzing the associations between hypertension in the past year and lifetime use of the main classes of classic psychedelics, namely tryptamines (N,N-dimethyltryptamine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin), lysergic acid diethylamide (a lysergamide), and phenethylamines (mescaline, peyote, and San Pedro), only the association with lifetime tryptamine use was significant (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80 [0.73-0.89]; P=0.0001). Though these associations are novel, rigorous randomized controlled trials are warranted to investigate potential causal pathways of classic psychedelics on blood pressure.","***TASK***

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (11 male, 10 female) were administered psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the DMN before and after psilocybin or placebo administration. Psilocybin significantly reduced BOLD signal in the DMN compared to placebo. This effect was most pronounced in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Psilocybin also significantly reduced functional connectivity between the PCC and mPFC. These findings suggest that psilocybin may exert its therapeutic effects by reducing activity in the DMN.

8030,"Prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult or distressing experiences using classic psychedelics.^\nPrevious studies have investigated challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences, but little is known about the prevalence and associations of such experiences. Using nationally representative data of the US adult population (N = 2822), this study examined the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing experiences using classic psychedelics, in a subsample of respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use (n = 613). Of the 613 respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use, the majority of them (59.1 %) had never had a challenging, difficult, or distressing experience using a classic psychedelic, but 8.9 % of respondents reported functional impairment that lasted longer than one day as a result of such experiences. Notably, 2.6 % reported seeking medical, psychiatric, or psychological assistance in the days or weeks following their most challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experience. In covariate-adjusted regression models, co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and six set and setting variables (no preparation, disagreeable physical environment, negative mindset, no psychological support, dose was too large, major life event prior to experience) were associated with the degree of difficulty; and co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and three set and setting variables (negative mindset, no psychological support, major life event prior to experience) were associated with overall risk of harm. In summary, this study provides insight into the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences. The findings broadly correspond with findings from previous studies and can inform harm reduction efforts and future experimental research designs.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult or distressing experiences using classic psychedelics.^\nPrevious studies have investigated challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences, but little is known about the prevalence and associations of such experiences. Using nationally representative data of the US adult population (N = 2822), this study examined the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing experiences using classic psychedelics, in a subsample of respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use (n = 613). Of the 613 respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use, the majority of them (59.1 %) had never had a challenging, difficult, or distressing experience using a classic psychedelic, but 8.9 % of respondents reported functional impairment that lasted longer than one day as a result of such experiences. Notably, 2.6 % reported seeking medical, psychiatric, or psychological assistance in the days or weeks following their most challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experience. In covariate-adjusted regression models, co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and six set and setting variables (no preparation, disagreeable physical environment, negative mindset, no psychological support, dose was too large, major life event prior to experience) were associated with the degree of difficulty; and co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and three set and setting variables (negative mindset, no psychological support, major life event prior to experience) were associated with overall risk of harm. In summary, this study provides insight into the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences. The findings broadly correspond with findings from previous studies and can inform harm reduction efforts and future experimental research designs.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of brain regions that are active during rest and deactivate during goal-directed tasks. The DMN is thought to be involved in self-referential processing and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the DMN in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 male, 12 female) were administered psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed at baseline and 1.5, 3, and 6 h post-drug administration. Psilocybin significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at 1.5 h post-drug administration. Psilocybin also significantly reduced the ALFF in the PCC and the mPFC at 3 h post-drug administration. These findings suggest that psilocybin reduces the activity of the DMN in healthy volunteers. This may be one of the mechanisms by which psilocybin exerts its therapeutic effects in depression and anxiety.

8089,"Psilocybin-assisted therapy for major depressive disorder: An exploratory placebo-controlled, fixed-order trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Several early phase studies have demonstrated that psilocybin-assisted therapy has rapid-acting and persisting antidepressant effects from just one or two doses. However, methodological limitations (e.g., placebo-control, blinding) limit interpretability of the existing literature. METHODS: In an exploratory placebo-controlled, within-subject, fixed-order study, individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo (n = 19) followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) (n = 15) 4 weeks later. Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy. Enhanced blinding procedures were used. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were measured over a 16-week study period. RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions. However, antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin (d' = 1.02-2.27) than after placebo (d' = 0.65-0.99) and there were high rates of response (66.7%) and remission (46.7%) following psilocybin administration. Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted, on average, for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood-related quality of life domains. The strength of mystical-type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy, therapy effects, and drug/placebo effects in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy studies. Nonetheless, the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression. Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support.","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

8798,"Is ketamine an appropriate alternative to ECT for patients with treatment resistant depression? A systematic review.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has repeatedly shown to have rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). An important question is whether ketamine is as effective and safe as the current gold standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: The literature was searched for trials comparing ketamine treatment with ECT for depression in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and Cochrane Trials Library. RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD. There are indications for a more favourable short term cognitive side effect profile after ketamine treatment. Methodologically well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up duration are warranted.","***TASK***

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Is ketamine an appropriate alternative to ECT for patients with treatment resistant depression? A systematic review.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has repeatedly shown to have rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). An important question is whether ketamine is as effective and safe as the current gold standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: The literature was searched for trials comparing ketamine treatment with ECT for depression in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and Cochrane Trials Library. RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD. There are indications for a more favourable short term cognitive side effect profile after ketamine treatment. Methodologically well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up duration are warranted.

INPUT: A qualitative study of the psychedelic experience: a phenomenological analysis.^\nPsychedelic drugs have been used for centuries for religious and healing purposes. However, the psychedelic experience has not been systematically studied. The aim of this study was to explore the psychedelic experience in a phenomenological manner. A qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach. The study was conducted in a psychiatric hospital in the Netherlands. The study population consisted of 10 healthy volunteers who had used psychedelic drugs at least once in their lives. The psychedelic experience was explored using a semi-structured interview. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a phenomenological approach. The psychedelic experience was characterized by a sense of unity, a sense of transcendence, a sense of self-transcendence, a sense of ego-dissolution, a sense of time distortion, a sense of space distortion, a sense of altered perception, a sense of altered body image, a sense of altered emotions, a sense of altered cognition, a sense of altered meaning, a sense of altered self-awareness, a

8836,"Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Ten patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation. RESULTS: Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD.

INPUT: The Effects of Psilocybin on Time Perception and Temporal Control.^\nPsilocybin, a serotonin 2A receptor agonist, is a classic psychedelic that has been shown to alter time perception. However, the effects of psilocybin on temporal control, the ability to control the timing of actions, are unknown. We investigated the effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal control in healthy volunteers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 participants received psilocybin (210 μg/kg) or placebo in counterbalanced order. Time perception was assessed using a temporal bisection task, and temporal control was assessed using a temporal production task. Participants also completed a battery of questionnaires assessing mood, anxiety, and psychedelic effects. Psilocybin increased the perceived duration of time intervals and decreased temporal control. These effects were associated with increased ratings of ""drug strength"" and ""drug liking"" and decreased ratings of ""anxious"" and ""bad drug effects."" These findings suggest that psilocybin alters time perception and temporal control, and that these effects are associated with the subjective effects of the drug.

8923,"Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127). FINDINGS: The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127). FINDINGS: The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm. FUNDING: The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Crowdfunding, the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, and the Heffter Research Institute.

INPUT: The effects of psilocybin on the default mode network in healthy volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist that has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of psilocybin on the default mode network (DMN) in healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (11 male, 10 female) were scanned twice, once after receiving a placebo and once after receiving psilocybin (200 μg/kg). Psilocybin significantly reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus, two key nodes of the DMN. Psilocybin also reduced the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region that is not typically considered part of the DMN. These results suggest that psilocybin may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety by reducing the activity of the DMN.

9113,"The effects of multitasking on psychological stress reactivity in recreational users of cannabis and MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is associated with psychobiological and neurocognitive deficits. Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.","***TASK***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

9163,"Ecstasy use in New Zealand: Findings from the 1998 and 2001 National Drug Surveys.^\nAims: To examine changes in the use of ecstasy, current conditions of supply, harms resulting from use, and the demographics of users. Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'. Ecstasy users were predominately male, aged 20-29, European and single, but were from a broad range of occupational and income-earning groups. Conclusions: The use of ecstasy in New Zealand increased between 1998 and 2001. Conditions of supply became easier. Users reported problems related to use in a range of areas of their lives. There was little evidence to suggest ecstasy use was limited to high-income-earning professionals. © NZMA.","***TASK***

The task is to classify the study type based on the title and abstract of a research paper.

***INPUT***

The input is the title and abstract text.

***DOCUMENTATION***

There are 9 Study Type options. The followings are the options and their definitions:

Randomized-controlled trial (RCT): A study where individuals are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, with one receiving a psychedelic substance and the others receiving a placebo or standard treatment, to compare outcomes directly. I.e., the study needs to check to attributes: 1) being randomized and 2) being controlled (e.g., with a placebo or an active control).

Cohort study: An observational study where a defined group of people (the cohort) is followed over time to study outcomes related to an exposure to psychedelic substance(s), comparing results within the group or with a different group not exposed to the substance. In most cases, it is explicitly mentioned that this is a cohort study.

Real-world study: Examines the relationship between variables (e.g., the use of a psychedelic substance and mental health outcomes) at a single point across a real-world population and setting. This includes real-world studies on recreational drug use, survey-based studies e.g., on MDMA use among healthy adults or studies assessing emergency department visits of people ingesting MDMA. Studies recruiting recreational drug users for additional interventions or experimental procedures such as taking blood or conducting EEG do NOT belong to this category.

Study protocol: A protocol of a clinical trial outlining methodology of a study still to be conducted. Annotate as if the study has been conducted.

Systematic review/meta-analysis: A comprehensive summary of all the available primary research on a specific psychedelic-related research question. Should mention the term systematic review and/or meta-analysis in the title/abstract. Meta-analyses only refer to published studies, i.e., pooling of different RCTs would be “Other”.

Qualitative Study: Explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and the impact of psychedelic substances through interviews, focus groups, or content analysis. Also includes studies focusing on religion/spirituality related to psychedelic substances.

Case report: A detailed report of the symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one individual patient/healthy participant.

Case series: A collection of case reports involving patients who were given similar interventions.

Other: A study not belonging to one of the above categories or not classifiable based on the provided information. A study pooling different RCTs together belongs to this category.

***OUTPUT***

The output should be in a json format, with relevant value for each option: Randomized-controlled trial (RCT), Cohort study, Real-world study, Study protocol, Systematic review/meta-analysis, Qualitative Study, Case report, Case series, Other

Put value 1 if the option applies to the research paper, 0 if it does not apply.

Please note again that a single option can be selected for each research paper.

INPUT: Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.

INPUT: Ecstasy use in New Zealand: Findings from the 1998 and 2001 National Drug Surveys.^\nAims: To examine changes in the use of ecstasy, current conditions of supply, harms resulting from use, and the demographics of users. Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'.
