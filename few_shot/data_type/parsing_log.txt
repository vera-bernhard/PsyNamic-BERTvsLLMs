	Error parsing prediction for row with id 2423 : Could not parse prediction: Based on the input provided, I would classify the study as "Longitudinal long." The study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of esketamine in treatment-resistant bipolar depression over a period of 14 days, with multiple dosing sessions and follow-up assessments. The study meets the criteria for longitudinal studies, as it involves repeated measurements of outcomes over a prolonged period. Specifically, the study is classified as "Longitudinal long

	Error parsing prediction for row with id 1238 : Could not parse prediction: Based on the input provided, I would classify the study as "Longitudinal long". The study has a total follow-up time of 81 days, with multiple assessments at different time points (days 1, 2, and 81), and the intervention is administered repeatedly (twice a week) over a period of 25 days. Therefore, the study meets the criteria for a longitudinal study with a long follow-up time.

The primary outcome measures will be the effects of MDMA on the rewarding and reinforcing effects of the drug, as well as the effects of MDMA on the emotional processing of music. The investigators hypothesize that methylphenidate will reduce the subjective effects of MDMA and that the effects of MDMA on the rewarding and reinforcing effects of the drug will be mediated by the DA transporter. The results of this study will provide insight into the functional role
