	Error parsing prediction for row with id 6072 : Could not parse prediction: 1) Background The therapeutic effectiveness of currently available antidepressant is low. Less than 50% of the patients achieve remission after single treatment, and about 30% after four different treatments. Besides low response rates, pharmacological treatment are associated with several side effects and response onset is usually long ( 2‐3 weeks). Thus, great effort has been made to the development of alternative antidepressants. For instance, ketamine, a N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has rapid and potent antidepressant effects in treatment of major

The results showed that ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the subjects, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy subjects that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the

Less than 50% of the patients achieve remission after single treatment, and about 30% after four different treatments. Besides low response rates, pharmacological treatment are associated with several side effects and response onset is usually long ( 2‐3 weeks). Thus, great effort has been made to the development of alternative antidepressants. For instance, ketamine, a N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has rapid and potent antidepressant effects in treatment of major

MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO.

The results showed that ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the subjects, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy subjects that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the
